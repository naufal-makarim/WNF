    "THE KING": [
      "“Begin at the beginning,” the King said, very gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.” – Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland WE know this story, and much like Alice, I feel like our current state is a wonderland, with the past couple of years being the rabbit hole. How did we get here?",
      "Nobody saw the pandemic coming. We were blindsided, barely making it through unscathed. What are we to do now? Can we predict what’s to come? As venture capitalists, we pride ourselves on being crystal ball readers, putting money where our mouths are. But do we really know when to stop? Let’s just recap before we pull the plug. At the beginning of 2020, mainstream media prophesied an apocalypse akin to the Book of Revelation. The Four Horsemen arrived at our doorstep, bringing plague, war, famine, and death. In 2019, no one could have guessed that.",
      "We didn’t die, though. We’re not in the best shape, but we’re still here. The mainstream media capitalized on the COVID-19 pandemic, invoking fear with endless updates on the virus spread and capturing panic 24/7. Increased viewership revenue resulted in decreased spending, causing the global economy to nosedive.",
      "The government had to intervene. Although fear-driven decisions often end poorly, something had to be done. The Indonesian government launched pre-employment cards and distributed welfare funds, encouraging people to go out and spend. The US tried to stall the rise of interest rates, and it worked, albeit momentarily. Stimulus measures boosted investor confidence and drove up asset prices. Every sector of business was left shook by the pandemic. The technology sector, and its exuberant backers, were no exception. Despite all the chaos across almost all tech sectors, I could say that my personal journey in the world of corporate ventures remained focused on building the synergy and bridging collaboration to bring together both legacy business and new innovation.",
      "For the past 10 years, my work has involved investing in high-growth startups, MDI and BRI Ventures respectively. I’ve spent eight years collaborating with two of Indonesia’s largest state-owned companies, focusing on digital transformation and corporate venture investment. I’ve worked with and invested in digital portfolio companies from 11 countries. In 2022, it dawned on me that the real crisis in the VC and startup world could be more significant than the virus itself; the real crisis could be... us. After a decade of building the ecosystem, or “ego system,” how many of us have achieved successful IPOs? We have been too arrogant with our prophecies, potentially “over-promoting” and enabling founders as the end-all and be-all. Now, stocks are gaining momentum again, but it wasn’t through our own financial infrastructures. The government had to play Deus Ex Machina to bail out the economy. Trillions of dollars were injected to ensure people spent money, with central banks buying government bonds and securities. People started working from home, and tech and e-commerce stocks spiked. Amazon, Apple, and Google rejoiced as their stocks reached all-time highs, and we agreed to call this the “New Normal.”",
      "I began investing in 2011 with Systec Ventures, a seed stage investment fund, just as some of Indonesia’s startups started to reach Series A round of investment. We invested in tech products to bring them to the mainstream market. I observed how piggybacking worked for Microsoft with Netscape and Apple with iPod and iTunes. The impact of one product, with a good strategy and marketing, could build something extraordinary. I naively believed that within the next 10 years, the startup ecosystem would become more “structured,” and companies could exit by securing a big IPO success.",
      "Adding grocery payment capabilities onto a simple app transporting a person on a motorbike takes immense work . It requires extensive research, databases, infrastructure, and more. Openness about the challenges a company faces is crucial. I don’t see many investors doing this; instead, they remain silent, potentially to save their own reputations while allowing the next investor to take the fall. MDI Ventures and BRI Ventures are two cases I will explore in later chapters. We all had hints or predictions about what was coming: market correction would happen eventually in 2019 or 2020, unicorns would start their path to profitability during this time, and so on. Fast forward, and the unthinkable happened. To quote Irrational Exuberance by Robert J. Shiller in 2001: “If asset prices start to rise strongly, the success of some investors attracts public attention that fuels the spread of enthusiasm for the market. Often the new and less sophisticated investors enter the market and bid up prices. This ‘irrational exuberance’ heightens expectations of further price increases, as investors extrapolate recent price action far into the future. The market’s meteoric rise is typically justified in the popular culture by some superficially plausible ‘new era’ theory that validates the abandonment of traditional valuation metrics. The bubble carries the seeds of its own destruction; if prices begin to sag, pessimists can take hold, causing some investors to exit the market. Downward price motion begets expectations of further downward motion, and so on, until the bottom is eventually reached.” It is challenging to predict precisely how global markets will recover in the coming years. A resurgence of a new virus or the implementation of new economic policies could once again dampen economic growth and weigh on global market conditions. Ultimately, the long-term performance will depend on the underlying strength of GDP growth, employment levels, and corporate earnings. Recovery will likely be a gradual — and painful — process and may not follow a straight line.",
      "This book does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the firms associated with me but serves as a personal take and a chronicle of my experience in investing, particularly in Southeast Asia, and how Indonesia became one of the most powerful startup ecosystems in less than a decade. Companies and investors now stand on higher ground because we have experienced both fiascos and promising success stories. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse will always be lurking. We have collected enough precedents, sense, and sensibility to be mindful of the risks and strategies to employ. You are equipped with a sort of wisdom for whatever the markets throw at you."

    "THE PERPETUAL DANCE OF VCS AND UNICORNS": [
      "IN 2009, during the early days of Indonesia’s startup scene, there was a company called SITTI, which claimed to be the Google for Bahasa Indonesia. At the time, I called this type of company a “unicorn” because it looked to achieve what seemed to be impossible, and thus, I believed, it shouldn’t exist. Not entirely sure why, but perhaps I was subconsciously influenced by the 2004 film, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, where a hilarious unicorn scene briefly steals the show.",
      "This was, of course, a few years before the term “unicorn,” as we know it now, was coined by Cowboy Ventures founder Aileen Lee in a TechCrunch article in 2013. Now, many would say that it is nothing but a myth based on a myth. The fact is that companies like Apple and Amazon were never labeled unicorns; they simply worked and grew into multi-billion-dollar tech giants. Ironically, startups nowadays, consider a unicorn status as a “you’ve made it” pat on the back, but the reality may not be as flattering. Achieving unicorn status is merely the beginning, as it brings increased complexity in operations, higher expectations, and many challenges to overcome.",
      "VCs have a love affair with the term ‘unicorn’ and have helped popularize it. It’s been making headlines since 2013, and we’ve even taken the concept further with the ultimate mythological beast — the decacorn! Yes, they are companies with a valuation of more than $10 billion, are supposedly too big to fail. They make a significant impact on many people and are tied to a nation’s GDP, among other factors. Meanwhile, a $1 billion valuation may seem arbitrary and often seem “too commonly used.”",
      "Unicorn companies and their VCs form a symbiotic relationship, validating and perpetuating one another’s existence.",
      "Perhaps before we start Chapter One, it would be helpful to share an article from the Harvard Business Review for those who may not be familiar with the subject at hand. Titled “How Venture Capital Works” and published in November 1998, the piece provides historical context to better understand the venture capital industry based on myth and reality. It’s a curious phenomenon to observe that my LinkedIn posts, among other things, seem to have become a wellspring of discontent for the venture capital industry. But let’s be honest, is it really that shocking? After all, venture capitalism is like an adrenaline junkie forever chasing the next high, hunting down investments that teeter precariously between high-risk and high-return. Now, with these sectors hitting some speed bumps, the ride’s getting a bit bumpy. Add to this the fact that startup founders are often like rebels without a pause. They’re forever making waves in the tranquil sea of the status quo, shouting ‘disruption’ from the rooftops and challenging the ‘old way of doing things’. It’s no wonder then that those comfortably ensconced in their well worn routines are getting a bit ruffled by these renegades of revolution. It’s like bringing a rock band into a library — there’s bound to be some displeased librarians. But hey, isn’t that what makes the game so exhilarating?",
      "In the early 90s, the US economy was driven by invention and innovation, with stories of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and their VC partners dominating headlines. Pioneers like Arthur Rock, Tommy Davis, and Tom Perkins played significant roles in shaping the modern computer industry. However, as the VC business evolved, this cowboy and sidekick image became increasingly outdated.",
      "Contrary to popular belief, venture capital played a minor role in funding basic innovation. In 1997, US venture capitalists invested more than $10 billion, with only 6% going to startups. The majority of the capital went to follow-on funding for projects initially developed through government and corporate expenditures.",
      "VC fills a void between sources of funds for innovation and traditional, lower-cost sources of capital available to ongoing concerns. The challenge for the VC industry was to consistently earn superior returns on investments in inherently risky business ventures. To achieve this, VCs focused on investing in high-growth industries while avoiding the early and late stages of the industry life cycle. If a venture capitalist claims to invest only in good people and ideas, they’re likely not being entirely truthful. In reality, VCs do invest in good industries. They mainly consign their risks to the company management’s ability to execute, targeting high-growth segments with exit opportunities. VCs focus on fast growing sectors with promising futures, such as energy, technology, and the internet. Entrepreneurs recognize that VCs seek businesses in high-growth segments because it’s easier to generate high returns in those areas. VC investments typically follow a distinct pattern: VCs buy a stake in the entrepreneur’s idea, nurture it for a short period, and then exit with the help of an investment banker. The deal structure offers investors ample downside protection and a favorable position for additional investment if the company proves to be a winner.",
      "Despite the seemingly steep disadvantage for entrepreneurs, they continue to seek high-cost capital from VCs. Entrepreneurs understand that partnering with VCs can provide access to talent, resources, and connections that would be impossible to obtain elsewhere. Moreover, venture funded companies attract talented individuals by appealing to a “lottery” mentality, where the potential for high rewards outweighs the risks.",
      "Venture capitalists expect the highest return on one or two of their investments. The real upside lies in the portfolio’s appreciation, where investors as the Limited Partners (“LP”) receive the majority of the gains, and VCs as the General Partners (“GP”) take the remaining portion. We will explore further into the GP-LP dynamic in a later chapter. Before we dwell too much on these, let’s take a look from the beginning of the story, shall we?"

  "CHAPTER ONE: THE DAY WE DISCOVERED THE BIT": {
    "THE DAY": [
      "We Discovered the Bit IN 1999, Kaskus emerged as one of the first and most popular online forums in Indonesia. This changed the way people saw their home computers; they were no longer just for doing homework. As enthusiasm grew, people began to embrace social media and digital technologies. By 2010, desktop computing was the main access to the internet, and BlackBerry was the go-to device for mobile apps. Customers could buy data service ‘by the day’ on prepaid phones, and billboard advertisements promoted access to popular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, bundled together with local phone and data services. This marked the beginning of a global connection at our fingertips, and it was a game changer.",
      "During this time, founders connected over Twitter and built a tight-knit community that valued collaboration with competitors, listening to employees, and fostering curiosity. Reminiscent of early Silicon Valley, they taught each other what they knew and grew together. TechCrunch wrote an article titled “What the Hell is Going on in Indonesia?” in 2010. At the time, the number of web users in the country was around 20 million or about 8% of the total population, and it was clear that there was enormous potential for growth. The rise of e-commerce and the increasing adoption of mobile technologies opened up new opportunities for entrepreneurs to build businesses. Online marketplaces like Tokopedia and Bukalapak, founded in 2010 and 2011, respectively, quickly gained traction and became major players in the Indonesian e-commerce space. However, local and international VC firms were initially hesitant to fund these initiatives, and entrepreneurs had to hustle to secure funding. The lack of much needed institutions like incubators, accelerators, and resources made it challenging to get businesses off the ground and scale up. Social media and other digital platforms played a vital role in connecting with end-users and building awareness during this period. Companies like Kaskus drove the adoption of social media and other digital technologies, creating a strong foundation for the growth of the Indonesian startup ecosystem. Despite these positive trends, early startup development in Indonesia faced several challenges, including the lack of access to capital and a limited ecosystem of support for startups. Entrepreneurs struggled to secure seed funding and find guidance needed to succeed in this new category.",
      "However, this early period of startup development in Indonesia was an exciting time for entrepreneurs and investors, as they saw the potential for building successful businesses in a large and untapped market. This laid the foundation for the growth of the Indonesian startup ecosystem in the years that followed. Some sources estimated 300 to 1,000 startup entrepreneurs (“founders”) were in Jakarta alone during this early internet boom. Most of these companies focused on building their user base rather than monetizing immediately. Indonesian customers were not yet willing to pay for web services, and there were limited options for payment. Advertising to market big brands was an open field, but there were only a few mass media platforms available. Capital and exits were not yet part of the lexicon. Recruiting developers was challenging, as companies had to train the manpower for several months to tailor their own industry-ready talents.",
      "As Indonesia prepped for its rise in the digital ecosystem, Singapore and Malaysia experienced significant growth during this period. Singapore saw an influx of global investors and a rising number of homegrown startups. In 2011, Singaporean e-commerce platform Lazada received a $26 million investment from Rocket Internet, propelling it to become a major player in the region. Singaporean gaming company Garena, which later became SEA Holding Limited, raised $170 million in funding, thus cementing Singapore’s position as a hub for technology startups in 2012. Malaysia also experienced growth in its startup ecosystem, with the government launching initiatives such as the Malaysia Global Innovation & Creativity Centre (MaGIC) and the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) to support local entrepreneurs. Then in 2013, Malaysian ride hailing service Grab received a $250 million investment from SoftBank, solidifying its position as a dominant player in the region.",
      "This period of growth established the landscape for the digital ecosystem in Indonesia, with founders and investors acting as cartographers, drawing the map together. The condition ushered a new era of growth, and Indonesia’s startup ecosystem continued to develop and expand, driven by a combination of innovation, collaboration, and investment. The challenges faced during these early days, including limited access to capital and a lack of supportive resources, only served to strengthen the determination and resilience of entrepreneurs who believed in the potential of the Indonesian market. Over time, this perseverance paid off, as more and more startups found success, and the digital ecosystem in Indonesia began to flourish."

    "EARLY BET ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP": [
      "BETWEEN 2011 and 2013, Indonesia became a popular destination for Silicon Valley players, following their expansion into India. The promising Southeast Asia, with its sizable addressable market, attracted major internet companies to establish bases in Indonesia. This growth was driven by the country’s expanding economy and increasing internet penetration.",
      "In 2011, Google opened a Jakarta office to expand operations and better serve its growing user base. Later, it announced plans to invest $1 billion in Indonesia over five years, focusing on initiatives like expanding the use of Google Maps and Google Earth, and supporting the local tech ecosystem through partnerships and investments. Facebook also set up its base in Indonesia, opening a Jakarta office in 2013. By that time, Facebook’s user base in Indonesia had reached over 40 million, making it one of the company’s largest markets in Asia. The presence of major internet companies in Indonesia not only reflected the country’s growing importance as a digital market but also contributed to the development of the local tech ecosystem and the growth of Indonesia’s digital economy.",
      "This early tech boom in Indonesia created a significant increase in demand for local talent, particularly in computer programming. The rise of coding schools and bootcamps helped meet this demand, producing a new generation of highly skilled developers. This influx of talent attracted more entrepreneurs and investors, leading to a surge in tech startups founded in the country.",
      "Indonesian entrepreneurs have always viewed the nation as a land of opportunity. Most conglomerate groups established in the 70s and 80s still stand as major players today. Millennials see this success as an excellent model to emulate, aiming to make it big and fast, knowing there’s a good chance they’ll stay big.",
      "During this period, high-profile deals were made between local startups and foreign internet companies. One notable deal was Yahoo’s 2010 acquisition of location based service Koprol, dubbed the “Asian Foursquare.” Other acquisitions included Groupon’s purchase of Disdus in 2011 and LivingSocial’s acquisition of Dealkeren in 2012, both daily deals websites seeking to tap into Indonesia’s growing e-commerce market.",
      "In addition to startups, established firms also sought to enter the digital space through new ventures or investments. For example, Djarum Group experimented with a corporate venture in Blibli, an e-commerce business focused on electronics. Major APAC players also entered Indonesia’s digital ecosystem. Japan’s Rakuten established a joint venture with MNC Media to set up an online marketplace, while China’s Alibaba entered the market through a joint venture with the Indonesian partner called Lazada Indonesia. Corporate venturing became a popular strategy for established firms in Southeast Asia for several reasons. It allowed them to tap into emerging technologies, access new markets, and engage with the local startup ecosystem. This approach also helped firms adapt to new technologies and trends, diversify revenue streams, and reduce risks associated with relying on a single business model.",
      "State-owned company Telkom Indonesia, the parent company of Telkomsel, also jumped in with digital initiatives such as Plasa.com, MSN Indonesia, Uzone, and Indigo Incubator. During this time, local seed and early stage VC firms started to emerge. Systec Ventures, the firm I co-founded, was not only eager to invest in some of these newly established startups but was also willing to venture-build some of the categories like an e-commerce app, loyalty membership app, and so on. Reflecting on our enthusiasm at the time, it’s clear that we were somewhat gullible, caught up in the excitement of the rapidly growing digital market — I wouldn’t necessarily say that we dared to venture into uncharted territory of startup investment. Rather, we were just way too excited about the fact that all of this was happening in our own backyard.",
      "Around that same period, more local VC firms began to appear, providing access to capital for those eager to tap into this new movement. As a result, the startup landscape in Indonesia started to flourish, with a multitude of new companies attempting to carve out their niche in various sectors.",
      "Within a short period of three years, nearly one hundred startups emerged across the archipelago, mostly concentrated in the Greater Jakarta area. The hype was certainly on, but was it sustainable? I would say that the rapid growth and dynamic nature of the Indonesian digital market at the time blinded many of us to its potential challenges, as we focused primarily on the opportunities that lay ahead."
    ],
    "AGENTS OF TRANSFORMATION": [
      "IN the early days of Indonesia’s startup ecosystem, there were three key types of players who contributed to its growth and development, each playing a different but essential role. Drawing inspiration from Malcolm Gladwell’s book The Tipping Point, these players can be categorized as “Mavens,” “Connectors,” and “Salesmen”. I think each of these guys had a unique impact on the early days of the startup scene, and their combined efforts laid the foundation for the digital ecosystem that exists today.",
      "I was inspired by this book after it came out in 2000, at the same time I witnessed the boom-and-bust in the dot-com period when I moved to Silicon Valley after graduating from university. Having been an amateur anthropologist myself, I became particularly attuned to the fact that building a successful startup ecosystem requires the collaboration of various individuals, each bringing their unique skills and expertise to the table. These insights resonated with me when I transposed them into the context of Indonesia’s local (and perhaps Southeast Asia’s regional) startup scene, where unique roles and collaborations are just as important. These roles are essential to the growth and development of the digital market in Indonesia, as they bring together the knowledge, network, and persuasive power needed to drive innovation and attract investment.",
      "The “Mavens’’ in this context were repatriated millennials who had studied and lived abroad and experienced the transformative power of technology firsthand. They brought back their knowledge and insights to Indonesia, fueling the creation of innovative and creative startups that addressed a variety of issues. Indonesian VC firm Intudo Ventures coined the term “SEA Turtles” to describe these individuals, highlighting their significance in the startup ecosystem. Originally used in the early 2000s to describe a significant influx of foreign educated individuals returning to mainland China, these “sea turtles” have since become a widely recognized trend across Southeast Asia. These guys played a crucial role in shaping the startup landscape by sharing their aspirations and entrepreneurial spirit with others. Founders of companies like Gojek, Grab, and Traveloka, as well as early employees of many Indonesian and Southeast Asian early unicorns, are among these “SEA Turtles” who returned home after studying abroad. Many people in the startup community are familiar with the story of how Gojek founder and Ruma (later known as Mapan) founder first met at Harvard. This encounter not only led to a collaboration that had a profound impact on the Indonesian startup ecosystem, but also created a compelling narrative of the founders’ origin story, reminiscent of the early days of Silicon Valley. These legendary stories have the power to inspire generations of entrepreneurs to come. The term “SEA Turtles” is a clever play on words, referring to both the SouthEast Asia region and the migratory nature of these individuals. SEA Turtles, smart isn’t it? While the Mavens provide the essential knowledge and expertise, their impact on the startup ecosystem would be limited without the ability to connect with others and disseminate that information. This is where the Connectors come into play.",
      "“Connectors” were essential in bringing people together and forming networks that supported the growth of the startup ecosystem. Early tech bloggers, who eventually became prominent media outlets like DailySocial, e27, and TechinAsia, were instrumental in cultivating a community of like-minded individuals who shared a passion for technology and entrepreneurship. By organizing meetups, summits, and exhibitions, they facilitated opportunities for learning, collaboration, and investment, creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurs and investors alike. As Indonesia’s advertising industry matured, some local agencies, such as Magnivate, were acquired by larger groups like WPP, which led to further consolidation and development. This also made it more challenging for smaller agencies and consulting businesses to compete. Nevertheless, these early bloggers and media outlets played a significant role in connecting investors, corporates, and entrepreneurs, and creating an industry that was almost non-existent during that time. Early digital media companies like Bubu built an “Indonesia-Silicon Valley Connection” for business people, government officials, and large corporations to have meetings inside some of Silicon Valley’s startup companies, such as Facebook (Now Meta), Apple, and Netflix. President Joko Widodo actually met Mark Zuckerberg inside Facebook’s campus in Menlo Park, California, during his visit to the United States in 2016, even playing ping pong together with the world-renowned founder. This connection was made possible by the efforts of these “Connectors,” who were instrumental in building bridges between Indonesia’s tech scene and global industry leaders.",
      "“Salesmen,” or investors, were key in providing the necessary financial support for startups to grow and realize their potential. They not only invested their own money but also connected startups with larger investors to further support their growth. These investors, including venture capitalists and angel investors, were crucial in driving the valuation and growth of startup companies, enabling them to create value and thrive in a competitive market. By putting their own skin in the game and seeking support from bigger investors, they played an essential role in the development of the startup ecosystem.",
      "Together, these three types of players formed the backbone of Indonesia’s startup ecosystem in its early days. Each played a distinct role in shaping the landscape and fostering an environment that allowed startups to grow and flourish. The collaborative efforts of Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen, including the influence of SEA Turtles and the involvement of companies like WPP, enabled Indonesia’s startup scene to evolve into the thriving ecosystem it is today, demonstrating the power of diverse perspectives and the importance of collaboration in driving innovation and growth.",
      "In the beginning, there were founders who claimed to possess intellectual property rights for big societal endeavors, such as eradicating traffic jams, interpreting data from social media to target the desired market, and data based predictions for presidential elections. Embracing wholeheartedly what science fiction promised with the help of tech algorithms, these founders were filled with wonder and enthusiasm. As the ecosystem evolved, however, the focus shifted to “ecosystem builders” rather than just individual creative geniuses. Successful Indonesian startup founders saw the massive opportunities in serving an underserved market and applied their creative problem-solving skills, sense of urgency, and execution abilities to make an impact. Many of these founders had backgrounds in consulting or other industries that gave them a broader perspective on the challenges faced in their local communities. They shared their vision and knowledge, and became inspirations to others."

    "CRUMBLING OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PART 1)": [
      "IN 2012, the Indonesian digital ecosystem experienced a series of setbacks that led to a temporary period of dormancy. The first of these came when Yahoo shut down Koprol, a popular social networking site in Indonesia. Yahoo said its decision was part of the company’s focus on “innovating core products and properties” and “driving revenue or engagement.” The closure followed a significant downsizing of Yahoo’s technical development team in the country. Koprol had a strong following among young users and was even considered a threat to Foursquare. Many experts believed that the social app’s demise could have been avoided if it had been better managed and monetized by Yahoo.",
      "The Jakarta Post, Indonesia’s English-language newspaper, referred to the move as a “crumbling of great expectations.” Within the same year, Yahoo laid off 2,000 employees worldwide, signaling the challenges the company faced in maintaining its global presence. During this period, e-commerce companies entering the Indonesian market faced numerous challenges, such as introducing and educating the market about new brands. This process required time, money, and adaptation to local tastes. Bank transfers and cash were the popular means of transaction, while shipping and logistics posed significant challenges due to the country’s terrain and geography. E-commerce companies had to contend with intense price wars, as many of them were willing to spend large amounts on marketing to gain market share for the zero sum game. In 2013, another blow to the ecosystem came when Japan’s Rakuten decided to end its joint venture with MNC, a move that many experts believed signaled the end of Rakuten’s e-commerce business in Indonesia. Though no official reason was given for the dissolution, it was thought that Rakuten Belanja Online (RBO), the company’s online shop had not been meeting expectations and goals in the country.",
      "Macroeconomic factors likely played a role in the failure of these joint ventures. Indonesia’s e-commerce market was characterized by rapid growth and intense competition, with local players often outperforming foreign entrants. Additionally, Indonesia’s infrastructure and payment systems presented challenges for foreign companies looking to enter the market. External factors may have also contributed to the failure of these joint ventures. For example, Yahoo’s struggles in Indonesia may have been exacerbated by the company’s overall struggles and lack of focus on the market. Groupon, on the other hand, faced intense competition from local daily deals sites and may have been unable to adapt to the unique needs and preferences of Indonesian consumers. In the next two years, Groupon shut down Disdus and other operations in Southeast Asia. The company had hoped to establish a presence in the Southeast Asian market but struggled to gain traction, ultimately succumbing to the intense competition from local rivals. Yahoo experienced a similar fate, as macroeconomic factors, lack of preexisting infrastructure, and inadequate customer service systems hindered its progress. Having the backing of a well known global brand and a strong local partner was not enough to succeed in Indonesia’s challenging market.",
      "As these events unfolded, the digital ecosystem in Indonesia took a step back, entering a quiet period for a while. However, this temporary setback would eventually pave the way for another resurgence in the country’s tech sector - the decade of e-commerce is about to set the wave. In the years that followed, the Indonesian startup ecosystem underwent significant growth and maturation, fueled by the lessons learned from these early failures and a revived focus on addressing the unique challenges of the local market. The “crumbling of great expectations” period also prompted local entrepreneurs and investors to reevaluate their strategies and prioritize homegrown solutions. This shift in focus led to the next generation of local startups that were better equipped to navigate the complexities of the Indonesian market. These companies leveraged their deep understanding of local consumer preferences, cultural context, and market dynamics to create products and services tailored to the needs of the Indonesian consumers. The digital ecosystem in Indonesia began to rebound, with local startups and businesses leading the charge. And along with this homegrown investors and ventures started to fuel the next decade of unicorn building. This short period of dormancy and the subsequent resurgence of the Indonesian digital ecosystem highlighted the importance of understanding and adapting to local market conditions. Foreign entrants and joint ventures, despite their global brand recognition and strong local partners, struggled to navigate the complexities of the Indonesian market. In contrast, local startups that were better attuned to the unique challenges and opportunities in the country began to thrive. The lessons learned during this period would shape the Indonesian digital ecosystem for years to come. The failure of foreign entrants like Yahoo and Groupon served as a cautionary tale for new entrants and encouraged greater focus on localization and market-specific strategies."

    "BEWARE OF ROTTEN SEEDS": [
      "THE theme of hype and myth has played a significant role throughout the history of the startup industry. Remember the movie “Pirates of Silicon Valley” with young Steve Jobs and Bill Gates competing for the PC dominance? The early days of Indonesia’s startup boom saw an influx of companies and investors from neighboring countries eager to jump the bandwagon on the immense potential of the rapidly growing market, but this excitement was also accompanied by the rise of swindlers, who sought to exploit the hype for their own gain, that ultimately undermining the long-term viability of the industry.",
      "The challenges faced by early ventures into the Indonesian market, such as Yahoo, Rakuten, and Groupon, were not solely the result of poor management or an inability to adapt to local markets. The risks of investing in an unknown territory during a time of hype also contributed to these challenges, as the rise of swindlers in the industry further complicated the landscape. This has been a recurring theme in the history of the startup or any industry for that matter, with similar stories playing out during the California Gold Rush and the dot com era. The temptation of get-rich-quick schemes led many to chase after grandiose plans and invest in ventures with little or no basis in reality. The prevalence of these fraudulent schemes not only led to significant financial losses for investors but also tarnished the reputation of the industry as a whole, and it all still happening as we speak today.",
      "The early days of the internet boom in Indonesia saw a similar pattern emerge, with fake online businesses and pyramid schemes becoming rampant, tarnishing the reputation of the burgeoning industry. The term ‘penipu,’ meaning swindler in Bahasa Indonesia, became associated with many startups at the time, a testament to the widespread presence of these fraudulent schemes. In the face of this adversity, the digital ecosystem in Indonesia was momentarily slumbered.",
      "As the industry grew, the hype surrounding internet based businesses began to subside, and a more cautious approach to investment emerged, or perhaps the same people changed the narrative to suit the context of growth? Here we are today as the startup industry finds itself at another critical juncture, with the past decade having seen unprecedented growth and innovation but also exposing concerning practices that threaten the long-term viability of the industry. The coming years are likely to bring about significant shifts, with the anticipated “startup winter” potentially revealing the true extent of the industry’s challenges. Overcoming these obstacles, the industry must learn and admit from past mistakes, not just focus on creating viable, sustainable ventures over chasing fleeting success. Addressing the prevalent issues of myopic strategies in the sector will allow us to establish a healthier environment where startups can flourish sustainably. This transformation will necessitate a more in-depth vetting process, a commitment to constructing businesses that are built to last with stable revenue generation, and fostering enduring relationships with customers, collaborators, and suppliers.

  "CHAPTER TWO: THE PLAY MONEY MYTH": {
    "THE PLAY": [
      "AT the 2016 Echelon Summit in Jakarta, a rookie venture capitalist was approached by a founder of a HR tech startup. The conversation started off as any other between two strangers — a solid handshake, a quick introduction, a fake smile. A couple of shared giggles later, the founder started pitching his company, and less than 10 minutes later, the VC casually uttered the magic words: “So, where do I wire the money?”",
      "If securing funding seemed like such a breeze back then, well that’s because it probably was. And this had a lot to do with intensifying pull factor.",
      "Following the early experiments and joint ventures in Indonesia’s digital ecosystem around 2013, global private funds began to show heightened interest in the country. The prevailing assumption was that lessons had been learned and the groundwork for growth had been laid. A palpable sense of optimism was felt among the local industry insiders, likely mirroring the sentiment experienced by their forerunners a few decades back.",
      "Back in the 1980s, Southeast Asia, with a particular emphasis on Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, underwent an economic surge. The advantageous positioning of the region made it an appealing nexus for global commerce, and a robust manufacturing foundation, particularly in electronics and textiles, propelled its economic expansion. Low labor costs and a favorable business environment further incentivized investment. During this era, the foreign exchange market thrived, contributing greatly to Southeast Asia’s economic prosperity. The escalation in global trade and investment resulted in an increased demand for foreign exchange services, thereby giving rise to a strong and stable foreign exchange market within the region. This market emerged as an affordable funding source for businesses keen on expansion.",
      "There was a discernible ripple of optimism that pervaded local industry stakeholders, reminiscent of the sentiment shared by their predecessors in the country some decades ago.",
      "Back in the 1980s, Southeast Asia—particularly the countries of Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia—witnessed an era of economic prosperity. The region’s advantageous geographical position rendered it a magnet for global trade, and a powerful manufacturing sector for electronics and textiles propelled its financial development. Inexpensive labor costs and a conducive business atmosphere further lured investments. During this time, the foreign exchange market thrived, acting as a significant catalyst in Southeast Asia’s economic ascent. A boom in global trade and investment resulted in a swell in the demand for foreign exchange services, leading to the formation of a thriving foreign exchange market in the area, which offered an affordable pool of funds for businesses aspiring to scale up. This epoch, fondly remembered as the “Indonesian Miracle,” saw financial institutions acquire financing at bargain rates from various sources, including commercial banks, insurance entities, and pension funds. In a similar vein, several factors ignited Indonesia’s startup explosion in the 2010s: the widespread adoption of mobile devices and internet accessibility and the surge in the number of internet users in Indonesia during this period created a hospitable environment for the rise of e-commerce and its adjacent businesses.",
      "The triumphs of Gojek and Tokopedia piqued the curiosity of young startup visionaries, and a robust network of incubators, accelerators, and other supporting organizations helped cultivate an ethos of innovation and daring that fostered the proliferation of startups.",
      "As with foreign exchange loan providers in the 1980s, venture capital firms in the 2010s were able to access cheap sources of funds due to various factors. These firms often secured funding from high net worth individuals, FOs (FOs), and institutional investors. These investors provided funding at a discounted rate in exchange for an ownership stake in the company, believing in its potential to generate significant future returns, and they did.",
      "In both cases, the cheap sources of funds enabled these financial institutions to take on riskier investments since they had a lower cost of capital. This allowed them to potentially generate higher returns for their investors and drive innovation and growth in the markets in which they operated.",
      "Big corporations, FOs and high net worth individuals were willing to invest “learning money” to gain knowledge and experience while generating financial returns. This investment served as a sort of tuition fee, granting a certificate that could open doors to greater earnings in the future. At the very least, all of the second or third generations of Indonesia’s biggest conglomerate families were exposed to venture funds, venture builders, or unicorn startups. These “scions” inherited the leadership roles of their family empires, endowed with the wealth and influence to invest in and support the growth of startups in the country. Lippo Group, for example, a leading Indonesian conglomerate with interests in real estate, media, and healthcare, saw its scions establish a VC firm called Venturra in 2015. Venturra has invested in and built several successful Indonesian startups, including Ruangguru, an educational platform that helps students understand school curriculums and prepare for standardized exams, and Ovo, the largest e-wallet company in Indonesia. These investments provided financial support and raised the profile of Indonesia’s startup scene on a global scale. E-commerce, fintech, and logistics companies flourished.",
      "In response to the increasing presence of VC firms backed by large conglomerates, state-owned companies began entering the startup funding scene through a practice known as “corporate venturing.” This approach allowed these companies to tap into the potential of new and innovative technologies and business models that could drive future growth. Corporate venture involves the establishment of dedicated funds or teams within the company to focus on investing in startups and supporting them with resources, expertise, and connections. By participating in this emerging area, state-owned companies aimed to play a role in shaping the future of Indonesia’s startup ecosystem.",
      "One example of this trend is the establishment of a CVC Unit by state-owned telecom firm Telkom Indonesia in 2015, MDI Ventures, which I had the privilege to co-found. The CVC Unit is responsible for identifying and investing in startups that have the potential to drive innovation within the telco industry and the wider digital media and communication sector. This was followed by Bank Mandiri with Mandiri Capital Indonesia in 2016, Bank Central Asia with Central Capital Ventura in 2017, and finally I had the opportunity to play a role in the founding of BRI Ventures by Bank Rakyat Indonesia by the end of 2019. A common myth that prevails within the startup ecosystem is that securing funding from VC or CVC firms signifies the ultimate achievement. Unfortunately, this misconception can hinder a startup’s growth and long-term success. When founders become obsessed with obtaining VC funding, they might prioritize short-term gains over more critical tasks such as refining their product or nurturing a loyal customer base. In some instances, founders may even decide to relinquish a significant portion of equity in their company or agree to unfavorable terms in their pursuit of VC funding. This is not an uncommon occurrence in our ecosystem.",
      "A real case in point is the contrasting fundraising approach of two fintech companies, which I will refer to, for obvious confidential reasons, as company “X” and “Y”. Company “X” is a fintech startup that raised over $100 million from VC in 2019, focused on rapid expansion and customer acquisition — going after its competitors who had started 2-3 years earlier, resulting in impressive growth metrics. However, this aggressive strategy led to unsustainable operations, and the company eventually crumbled under the weight of its own expectations. Second, Company “Y”; another fintech company in the same category as Company “X” opted for organic growth without VC funding, but rather a venture built with only a few non-VC investors. By concentrating on building use cases internally, the company evolved into a profitable business until it got acquired by one of the region’s tech giants.",
      "Moreover, another issue that arises is that the chase for venture capital funding can instigate a culture of short-term orientation and an emphasis on metrics that might not hold significant or enduring value. For instance, some startups might prioritize amassing a vast user base or generating hype over establishing a robust, sustainable business blueprint. This approach can lead to an “expansion at any expense” mindset, which could jeopardize the company’s longevity. One facet that the general populace may not comprehend is that the majority of VCs are, in fact, fund managers entrusted with the task of identifying high-risk, high-reward assets for investment. Their investors, often termed Limited Partners (LPs) in a fund, are usually affluent individuals who might already be triumphant business proprietors. They might have ventured into various sectors, such as coal mining or palm oil plantations, but don’t necessarily have a strong grasp of tech investment. While critics are engrossed in their preferred diversion — disputing the genuineness of technological innovation in these startups (Is it genuinely tech, or merely tech-lite? Is it a no-tech facade of tech, or just an app masquerading as tech?), one cannot deny the irresistible pull of this sector for investors in dynamic emerging markets like Indonesia.",
      "Depending on the fund’s unique mission statement, whether it’s fostering collaboration and business growth in the style of corporate ventures, trailblazing as a lead-money venture, or adopting a scatter-gun approach with a ‘spray and pray’ venture, it seems some funds might just be dipping into their ‘play money’ jar.",
      "After all, in this vast playground of venture capitalism, there’s a slide for every backside, a swing for every risk-taker, and a sandbox for those who prefer to play it safe. So, let’s grab our buckets and spades and start building."

    "THE FOLLOW-ON GAME": [
      "“UNFORTUNATELY, we’ve oversubscribed the round by a million, we can’t take your money right now, but perhaps the next round?”, said one founder at an annual tech conference in Jakarta in 2016.",
      "During the period of 2016 to 2020, Southeast Asia’s startup companies frequently found themselves “oversubscribed,” attracting more investment offers than they expected or could accept. This situation presented both opportunities and challenges for founders, as they navigated the follow-on funding frenzy driven by the allure of easy money. In the early 2010s, startups like Lazada and Grab secured massive funding rounds and caught the media’s attention. As these companies disrupted traditional industries, investors experienced FOMO (fear of missing out), resulting in oversubscription and a race to invest in the next big thing. This rush for follow-on investments enticed founders with the prospect of rapid growth and financial success. Securing significant funding can be a blessing and a curse for founders unaccustomed to handling large financial resources. It’s crucial for these individuals to understand that merely having funds cannot rectify deep-rooted issues within a company; in fact, it can sometimes amplify already existing problems. Rather, their attention should be directed towards fostering connections with prospective investors and ensuring open communication about their decision-making methods.",
      "Many successful companies took their time to grow, “bootstrapping” themselves until they achieved product market fit and demonstrated commitment before seeking additional funding. This patient approach often leads to a more sustainable business model and stronger partnerships with investors. When considering angel investors, founders should carefully evaluate whether the partnership would be a good cultural fit and ensure both parties are aligned on expansion plans.",
      "To attract follow-on funding from larger players like Softbank Vision Fund, Tiger Global, and Sequoia Capital, founders must demonstrate the ability to generate strong returns. This can be achieved by showcasing successful past exits, leveraging a robust network of advisors, mentors, and industry experts, or participating in corporate incubator or accelerator programs.",
      "In the early days — and perhaps even today for some — misconceptions about VC investment abound. Many hear the term “easy money” and assume it’s the key to startup success — or perhaps the get-rich-quick-scheme type of success. Unfortunately, some fund managers were too busy playing rockstars or politically correct diplomats and have failed to clarify their objectives and strategies, leaving entrepreneurs in the dark. Meanwhile, the media often sensationalizes the role of VC, stoking the debate on high-growth startups versus traditional or corporate-led startups.",
      "In reality, not all businesses are a good fit for venture capital investment. VC firms support high-growth potential startups with innovative ideas, often taking an equity stake in exchange for funding. They’re less concerned with short term dividends and more focused on long-term success, such as an IPO or acquisition. The average holding period for a VC investment is about 5-7 years, which requires patience and a shared vision between the founder and the investor. Founders often wonder why their profitable businesses don’t attract VC investment. The reason is that VC firms are looking for startups that can rapidly scale and disrupt traditional industries, not just generate immediate profits. Startups with agency or software house business models, for example, rely on client relationships and may not be able to scale as quickly or as easily as VC firms would like. It’s essential to recognize that venture capital money isn’t the best way to raise bootstrap capital for early stage founders. Founders who accept VC money may need to give up a portion of ownership in their company, potentially losing control over their business. Moreover, VC firms typically have a specific investment thesis, so a solid business idea may not always align with their strategy. This misalignment can be frustrating for founders who are unable to secure VC funding. VC funding often leads founders to prioritize raising funds over building a strong product or business model. It is the VC business model to build momentum for its portfolio to win its competition. In fact, it’s unlikely — some would call unethical — for a VC to invest in two similar companies within one category or vertical. In contrast, bootstrapping allows founders to focus on building a solid foundation for their business, making decisions that are in the company’s best long-term interests rather than merely meeting short term financial targets.",
      "For investors, especially the lazy ones, following others into deals is sometimes the quickest way to deploy money. You see, VCs tend to feel ‘safer’ in many ways when investing as part of a syndicate. One (sometimes two) lead investor would take the initiative, and the rest would simply tag along. When money was easy to come by, one VC might say, “Just get in our next round, don’t worry about a thing, next year this baby will go unicorn!”",
      "Silly but true, and the other VCs would just go around spreading the unicorn gospel to their peers, creating a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts. The buzz would spread like wildfire, and before you knew it, everyone wanted a piece of the action, a slice of that mythical unicorn pie. However, during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, many founders put their fundraising efforts on hold, waiting for better opportunities to arise. Some startups turned to venture debt firms to extend their runway without sacrificing equity. While venture debt has not been a popular option in Southeast Asia, the economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic has increased its use, allowing startups to preserve equity and extend their runway for long-term success.",
      "This created a conundrum for VCs, who were itching to deploy their funds. After all, VCs need to invest, or there would be no reason for LPs to put their money into venture funds in the first place. As a result, VCs were forced to get creative and find new ways to put their capital to work. The only way forward was to scout for newly minted startups, dress them up a bit, and slap a high valuation on them. In these uncertain times, VCs had to adapt their strategies and take on riskier bets, putting their faith in fresh-faced startups with unproven business models. While this may have seemed like a gamble, it was a necessary move for VCs who needed to keep the wheels of their investment machine turning. The high valuations for these new startups were partly driven by the scarcity of investment-worthy companies and partly by the need for VCs to justify their own existence to their LPs.",
      "This whirlwind of action in the startup universe spawned some fascinating ripple effects. It birthed a landscape where the norms were perpetually shifting, demanding vigilance from both entrepreneurs and investors. Moreover, it led to certain startups, which might have faced challenges securing funding under normal circumstances, suddenly finding themselves under the limelight, reveling in the warmth of lofty valuations and abundant capital.",
      "VC funding can help some startups roll the boulder over the hill, but if you are a founder, you must maintain the 20/20 vision of its limitations and drawbacks. There are many ways to Rome, and surely, in a world turned upside down by a global pandemic, flexibility, adaptability, and a willingness to explore unconventional paths to success are more important than ever. But what happens when everything returns to normal?"
    ],
    "THE CLUBS WE’RE DEALING": [
      "“THE game was rigged from the beginning! The tech media, the investors, the so-called founders, they are all in it together!” cried one startup founder who never took money from VC — though in this particular case he had actually been rejected by a few, hence the resentment. One of the biggest misconceptions about venture investment is the perception that the game has been tampered from the start to favor an undeserving few. Many entrepreneurs feel that the tech media, investors, and founders are all in it together, creating an exclusive club that’s difficult to break into. This perception isn’t entirely unfounded, as syndication and “club deals” can create a herd mentality among investors, which can be frustrating for entrepreneurs seeking funding. However, the reality is that startup investment is a momentum game, not solely based on numbers.",
      "In Silicon Valley and other tech hubs around the world, there are well-known investment clubs, where VC firms consistently co-invest together in early stage startups. These deals typically involve a small group of firms with a shared investment thesis and a history of successful collaborations. Examples include the “PayPal Mafia” and the “Fireside Chat” group, which have backed multiple successful startups. Club deals can be advantageous for both VC firms and the startups they invest in, as they provide access to a wider range of deal flow and valuable resources. The VC community is a small world, even in the tech hub of Silicon Valley, and it’s even smaller in Southeast Asia. The VC community in Southeast Asia is relatively young, with many of its members being first-generation investors and investment professionals. This closely-knit ecosystem can cultivate a feeling of faith and comradeship amongst investors, facilitating smoother transactions and prosperous joint ventures. Naturally, in every domain of the business universe, individuals would be more at ease executing deals with those they already know. Such proclivity is anchored in human instinct, as we’re more inclined to place our trust in those we’ve developed relationships with over time. Your personal experience offers a valuable perspective into this occurrence. My principle in this is simple: if the deals turned sour, then most likely I wouldn’t do business with this or that particular VC anymore.",
      "The established relationships in the VC world can serve as both a boon and a bane. These relationships, on one hand, can pave the way for productive partnerships and investments, as each party gains a deeper comprehension of the other’s abilities, drawbacks, and anticipations. Such mutual understanding can facilitate more seamless transactions and possibly advantageous outcomes for both the startup and the investor. However, on the flip side, as I previously highlighted, when transactions go awry, these tight-knit bonds can come under pressure and may even culminate in a reluctance to work together down the line. This could limit the opportunities available to entrepreneurs who have experienced a setback with a particular investor. For both investors and entrepreneurs, it’s essential to maintain open lines of dialogue and learn from each other’s encounters, enabling them to overcome obstacles and pursue growth.",
      "Nevertheless, the VC community’s intimate nature can foster a sense of exclusivity, potentially curbing opportunities for newcomers and startups.",
      "The closely-knit network of investors can present hurdles for novices aiming to penetrate the market, possibly constraining the spectrum of concepts and hampering the discovery of the next breakthrough. Intimate ties among investors could result in potential conflicts of interest and biases that impact their investment choices, along with a lack of diversity in their startup investments. There are also fears that these investor cliques could reduce diversity in the startup environment, with a handful of VC firms ruling the funding landscape. This insularity poses the risk of missing out on innovative opportunities outside of their established network.",
      "Despite the challenges presented by these “exclusive clubs”; there are opportunities for entrepreneurs to break into the VC investment ecosystem. One approach is to build relationships with investors early on and cultivate a network of supporters who can vouch for the startup’s potential. Additionally, entrepreneurs can target corporate investors, foreign direct investors, and other “outsiders” who may not be as entrenched in the club deals, though they may come with their own risks and challenges.",
      "Among those risks is the perception that these “outsiders” may not fully understand the context of investing in the region. As a result, they could be the “greater fools” in the game, and this is when business ethics come into play. Then again, this is easy to say during the boom time, but not so much in a time of bust, as more investors are trying to cash in or salvage from whatever they have left to survive. For most investors that are not “in the club” so to speak, they usually come in late to the round, or as I like to put it: they are Chasing Unicorns — when everybody has left the party."

    "MONEY THAT MATTERS": [
      "FUND managers who assist founders are considered smart money, and with smart money, there is always a counterpart — dumb money. Compared to the developed markets, arguably, Southeast Asia does not have a large pool of highly educated talent working on cutting-edge technologies, and it is not a destination for space exploration for example. Instead, most local startups are focused on addressing basic needs such as improving access to goods and merchandise, money, and perhaps basic healthcare in remote areas.",
      "In this region, the choices for smart money are somewhat limited. But beggars can’t be choosers. Dumb money has funds to give but not the knowledge and experience. They wouldn’t know why there is a canary in a coal mine. These amateur investors flaunt their social feeds, filled with photos of them alongside the country’s decision-makers, and their faces in high-fashion magazines that nobody buys. Yet, they can’t assist you in making that crucial shot. A lot of these amateur investors are attracted to small investments in early stage startups, and you may be tempted to take the bait. We saw this with Zenefits, a San Francisco-based startup that provides software for managing human resources until it was revealed that the company had grown too quickly and had allowed unlicensed brokers to sell insurance, leading to a $7 million fine from regulators. In the cases of Theranos and WeWork, it’s not entirely the fault of the founders; the demands of the industry for aggressive action and immediate results drove them to that point. Smart money can be reckless too, as it appeared.",
      "The Southeast Asian startup scene is vibrant and is expected to continue growing in the foreseeable future. However, the industry, encompassing both VC and startups, can often be shrouded in illusion, with entities employing guile to entice investment from those less seasoned or informed in the sector. This issue is particularly rampant in the Southeast Asian region, where the startup landscape has witnessed remarkable expansion in the last ten years. The surge of capital and investment into the region has successfully positioned Indonesia and Southeast Asia prominently on the map for startup investment. With China tightening regulations on its tech landscape in 2019, the trend of venture investment in the country has been waning, leading many to anticipate a massive influx of capital into the Southeast Asian region in the forthcoming years. However, what renders Southeast Asia a captivating market is that each country within the region possesses its own unique startup ecosystem and market traits. This indicates that a blanket approach to marketing and growth will likely falter, as companies need to adjust their strategies to cater to each market’s specific requirements and tastes. For instance, Indonesia and Thailand present vastly different market profiles and segments, and a strategy successful in one country may not necessarily yield the same results in the other. This underscores the importance of local knowledge and expertise in facilitating business success in the Southeast Asian market. With heavy regulation on fintech in this region, it becomes essential for companies to forge relationships with local regulators and policymakers to traverse the intricate regulatory landscape and secure market access. This demands considerable time and resources, but patience and determination will ultimately reap rewards.",
      "High level of price sensitivity among consumers in the region equals expensive customer acquisition costs (CAC) for promotions and subsidies, particularly in the B2C and C2C segments. Price war comes with a cost with Southeast Asian consumers. You would need to either offer affordable products and services or find authentic means to stand out in order to justify higher prices. Upon entering these waters, pay attention to a firm’s wet powder and dry powder stance. Dry powder refers to the amount of capital that is unallocated and ready to be deployed in new investments. It is called “dry” because it is not yet committed to any specific investments, and can be thought of as being ready to ignite and fuel new opportunities. For example, a VC firm with a large amount of dry powder might have several potential investments under consideration, but has not yet committed any of its capital to any specific deal. Wet powder, on the other hand, refers to capital that is already committed to specific investments. It is called “wet” because it has been used and is no longer available for new investments. For example, an investor who has already committed their capital to a specific company or asset would have less wet powder available for future investments. Dry powder, you can touch. Wet powder, you can see. Balance between dry and wet powder is key, too much of either can be detrimental. I can say that a VC firm with too much dry powder may struggle to find attractive investment opportunities, while the one with too much wet powder may have limited flexibility to respond to new opportunities or changes in market conditions.",
      "In the VC industry, for example, it is common for firms to aim for a balance of 60-80% dry powder, with the remainder being committed to ongoing investments.",
      "Southeast Asian startups had a banner year in 2021, with a record $25.7 billion with $6 to $10 billion in Indonesia in funding raised. However, the recent economic crisis has brought about a “funding winter,” with VC firms arguing that this will ultimately be a positive development that will weed out weaker businesses and leave more rewards for stronger ones. While it may be more difficult for startups to secure funding, data shows that global fintech funding actually increased in pre-seed rounds during the first half of 2022, with average deal sizes also increasing across all funding rounds. This suggests that the startups that were successful in raising funds were able to secure larger amounts, even compared to the all-time-high levels seen in 2021, though there had been a decrease in the number of deals. With money, come vultures — sometimes dubbed as “Vulture Capitalists” — comprehend money with clarity and zero sentimentality. They can read crises well and swarm on top of money casualties — startups that barely made it through the “funding winter”. The recent economic meltdown really weeded out weaker businesses, leaving more businesses in a desperate, “anything goes” state.",
      "Venture capitalists provide funding for businesses with a great idea but not enough money to bring it to market, or for established companies that need additional financing to reach the next level. They are willing to take risks on startups and ideas that may take millions of dollars and time to prove and build. Some VC-funded startups fail, while others become successful and profitable. Vulture capitalists, on the other hand, focus on buying distressed assets, such as companies or property that are in trouble, mismanaged, or heading towards bankruptcy. They believe they can turn the asset around or liquidate it before it goes into bankruptcy. Vulture capitalism can be seen as predatory by some, while others view it as offering something rather than nothing. In such stormy weather, venture capitalists understand the risks and are willing to go through options with founders. Vultures see distressed assets, such as companies that are in trouble, mismanaged, or heading towards bankruptcy, to dismantle and liquidate. Predatory? Better than nothing? Smart or the opposite end of the spectrum? You be the judge."

    "THE SLEEPING GIANTS AWAKEN": [
      "CORPORATIONS with all the funds to make changes are historically known to not do so. One would think Polaroid should be Instagram’s dad, but it isn’t, not even its illegitimate child. Innovation and market adaptation are what startups and VCs bring to the forefront, even if they are still a small fish. But the Goliaths are catching up at last, especially in telecommunications.",
      "Long before Softbank, the Japanese telecom giant, launched its Vision Fund, Singapore-based telecommunications giant Singtel was one of the first companies in Asia to recognize the need for innovation within the industry. In 2010, the company established Singtel Innov8, a corporate venture company focused on incubating and investing in innovative technologies and solutions. This move was followed by Australian telecommunications company Telstra, which launched Telstra Ventures in 2011.",
      "Both Singtel Innov8 and Telstra Ventures have played a crucial role in their respective companies’ efforts to adapt to the rapidly changing telecommunications market. By nurturing and channeling resources into groundbreaking technologies, these corporate venture entities have enabled their parent companies to maintain a competitive edge and remain pertinent in a perpetually evolving industry. Corporate venture arms like Singtel Innov8 and Telstra Ventures have catalyzed the emergence of fresh technologies and solutions that have reaped advantages for not just the companies themselves, but also their clientele and the entire industry. For instance, Tencent, one of the colossal tech titans of China, operates a corporate venture wing known as Tencent Investments. This venture arm has financed a multitude of successful startups, including Flipkart and Practo in India, as well as Didi Chuxing in China. These investments have allowed Tencent to tap into innovative ideas and technologies, ultimately strengthening their own offerings and position in the market.",
      "In 2017, Singtel led a consortium that invested $700 million in Grab, which has since become the dominant player in Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing market. This investment not only gave the telco giant a stake in a promising startup but also helped it co-create the growth of the ride-hailing industry and better understand the needs of consumers in this space. However, not all of corporate venturing efforts have been successful. In 2015, the company invested in video streaming service HOOQ, which struggled to gain traction in the highly competitive market and ultimately shut down in 2020. This example highlights the inherent risk involved in corporate venturing, and the need for large corporations to carefully evaluate potential investments. In Indonesia, Telkom Indonesia was the first corporation in the country to launch an open innovation program with the establishment of its Indigo Incubator in 2012. The Indigo Incubator is a program designed to invite startup founders to create solutions and ideas for products that can be used by Telkom Indonesia. As a state-owned company listed on both the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Telkom Indonesia is a major player in the region’s telecommunications market. The company has a number of business divisions, including enterprise solutions, data centers, payments, and multimedia, and its subsidiary Telkomsel is partially owned by Singtel. The establishment of the Indigo Incubator in 2013 reflects Telkom Indonesia’s recognition of the value of open innovation and the importance of staying attuned to the needs and ideas of startups and innovators.",
      "But the idea is rather ideal on paper than in reality. Over the initial years, various startups enrolled in the Indigo Incubator program, aiming to team up with Telkom Indonesia to commercialize their novel products and concepts. Nonetheless, many of these nascent enterprises encountered hurdles in achieving the anticipated collaboration. A significant roadblock has been the absence of a product-market fit, hindering these firms from adequately demonstrating the merit of their propositions to Telkom Indonesia and obtaining the required endorsement to take their products to the consumers.",
      "Consequently, several of these startups couldn’t acquire the necessary financial backing and support to persist in their operations. This resulted in numerous firms dissolving due to a capital shortfall, despite the initial potential of their ideas and technology.",
      "While the program did succeed in providing these businesses access to initial capital grants, some startups found it challenging to deftly maneuver through the intricate process of product commercialization and the procurement of required funding.",
      "Remember that securing an initial grant doesn’t necessarily secure a ticket to the subsequent round. This harsh reality highlights the importance of ensuring that corporate-backed programs are not only providing financial support but also the necessary mentorship, guidance, and resources to help startups navigate the often turbulent journey to success. The experiences of Singtel Innov8, Telstra Ventures, and Telkom Indonesia’s Indigo Incubator demonstrate that corporate money can play a significant role in filling the gap between early stage seed funds and later-stage funds dominated by foreign investment giants. This highlights the critical nature of meticulous assessment, strategic congruence, and persistent support for these investments to genuinely effect a significant difference.",
      "As corporate titans in Asia and further afield start appreciating the merits of fostering innovation within their sectors, it becomes crucial that they approach these investments with a well-rounded comprehension of the startup terrain and the distinct hurdles that these fledgling companies grapple with. Ideally, they can ensure that their investments catalyze substantial change, spur industry expansion, and ultimately enhance the enduring success of both the startups and their own firms.",
      "Reflecting on my near-decade experience in corporate ventures, it’s noteworthy that corporate venture capital (CVC) encounters a particular predicament, especially within the backdrop of Indonesia’s corporate landscape.",
      "VC is exceedingly risky and competitive, and in corporate Indonesia is terrifyingly misunderstood. As a result, corporate venture capitalists tend to not get too excited when startups show them their ‘magnum opus’ or various forms of get-rich quick schemes that come with their budding companies. Instead, they’re looking for plays that can help satisfy a more nuanced double bottom line.",
      "With CVC, the roadmap is trickier than it is with traditional startup investing. Not only are you backing startups with large sums of cash and working closely with founders, an in-house CVC team also has to take heed from its parent company. This is how it works for the most part in Indonesia. I’m talking about the likes of large, state-owned blue chip enterprises — think banks, telcos, etc. Also, there’s just as much to gain as there is to lose, and the numbers are telling — every quarterly for the duration of the fund! Increasingly, large corporations in the market are choosing to put money into startups, as well as focusing on internal, traditional corporate investments. Last year, global CVC-backed investments reached a record-high of $163 billion, charting a year-on-year increase of 142%. On top of tech giants like Google and Intel — the usual suspects we might look to when thinking of high-risk, high-reward, tech oriented investments.",
      "For new players in CVC, there is one big, pervasive keyword to be extra-wary of: ‘synergy and collaboration.’ In Southeast Asia, when it comes to top-tier startup deals (most of which will include a deep bench of co-investors) a good CVC should always ask himself: why would any investor share their best deals with us? In response, founders and co-investors will throw out buzzwords like ‘synergy’ or ‘collaboration,’ and in theory, the ideas they propose do make sense. After all, for instance, why wouldn’t the nation’s largest MSME lender be able to get value from a P2P lending app or an open banking platform?",
      "Contrary to popular belief, however, the truth of the matter is that reconciling these potential synergies and manifesting them into real life business outcomes is easier said than done.",
      "In the early days of MDI Ventures, I spoke with a fund manager from Singtel Innov8 Ventures to discuss the potential dilemma of CVC. Singtel is also a majority shareholder of Telkomsel, so, in a way, we’re sort of like cousins? I expressed my concern that any CVC operating solely on the principle of synergy is ultimately designed to fail. The fund manager replied that while synergy is important, it is equally crucial for CVCs to address the return on investment. He explained that the CVC model is not entirely dissimilar to that of a traditional VC without corporate backing, and that it is wise to divide the operation into two parts: the pure fund management aspect of the business, and the venture build management aspect of the business.",
      "I believe this prompted the entire CVC game in Indonesia, including MDI Ventures and BRI Ventures, to be always careful and discerning. At the end of the day, the carrot we are chasing is financial returns — and not the satisfied agendas of our peers in other business divisions. Venture returns must be paid in cash, not bolts and parts. It’s also important to have your corporate parent company, like Telkom Indonesia for MDI Ventures, impose guardrails. As much as possible, make use of your in-house corporate compliance division as a sort of gatehouse to protect startups from becoming overhauled.",
      "When making deals, we must view the prospect of IPO and M&A as our primary compass. As corporate investors, synergy with our parent company is a great upside to investing, but it cannot — and should not — be the primary thing that a CVC fund manager focuses on.",
      "After all, returns are what keep all VCs and CVCs in business."

    "THE GAME": [
      "VC X : “Hey Nicko, you should take a look at this company. This is a growing sector I promised you. The founders are all legit, they’ve done it in stealth mode for a while, shall I make an introduction?”",
      "VC Y : “Have you guys heard of this new Web4 company? They don’t need investors right now, but when they’re ready, I will set up a meeting with your team.” (I was trying to sound silly) IN the high-risk realm of Southeast Asian start-ups, aspirations soar and entrepreneurs envision making their mark on the global stage. Propelled by a dedication to swift expansion and a willingness to venture into the unknown, these business owners aim to establish themselves in an ecosystem still lagging behind the heavyweights like the US. However, going public is not without its drawbacks, including high IPO costs, increased operational expenses, managing shareholders’ expectations, loss of privacy, and limitations on management’s freedom to act.",
      "Understanding the important role of startups in their economies, governments throughout Southeast Asia have been actively working to foster and support their domestic startup ecosystems since the early part of the 2010s. Many countries in this region have set up new stock exchange platforms tailored to accommodate the specific needs of startups and small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs). In 2017 and 2018, the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (HSX), the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), and the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX) all launched startup-centric boards. Through the establishment of the HSX Start-Up Market and the HNX Start-Up Market, these stock exchanges aimed to grant startups smoother access to capital.",
      "Simultaneously, Singapore has been focusing on evolving into a comprehensive financial hub in Asia. The island nation leveraged the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to support technology listings, offering a less rigorous listing process through its SGX Catalist board and additional guidance for tech companies via the SGX Tech IPO scheme. To further bolster its startup ecosystem, the SGX launched SGX Venture, a digital platform designed to enhance the visibility of listed companies. Additionally, the exchange forged strategic partnerships with various VC firms, accelerators, and technology hubs. The government also provided equity funding for early stage startups through the Startup SG Equity scheme and the Enterprise Singapore agency, creating a strong pipeline of startups ready for listing on the SGX. Not to be outdone, Indonesia introduced its own startup focused board in 2016, called the Indonesia Innovation Board (IIB), as part of the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). The IDX also launched initiatives such as the IDX Start-Up Market and the IDX Angel Market to help startups access funding and investors. However, in its early days, the IDX faced competition from a trend of startup consolidation driven by major regional tech players like Grab and Gojek, who acquired smaller startups such as Kudo, Kartuku, Midtrans, and Mapan. From my nearly a decade of investing experience, I observed that startups seemed to favor these types of exits due to the regulatory hurdles and intense competition in sectors dominated by major players that come with going public through an IPO. Additionally, between 2017 and 2019, investment in Indonesia was primarily funneled toward mature-stage companies, making it difficult for early stage startups to secure initial funding.",
      "Progressing to the current time, the dynamics have shifted. With the field prepared and the launchpad set, entrepreneurs are equipped to steer their startups towards unprecedented success, maneuvering through the intensely competitive realm of the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem. The Greater Fools’ Game has begun, and all eyes are on the coveted prize: a successful exit and a place among the industry’s “elite” – and we all know how the story goes, don’t we?"

    "THE WILD, WILD SOUTHEAST": [
      "THE Wild, Wild Southeast perfectly captures the essence of the startup ecosystem in the region. Much like the American Wild West, Southeast Asia’s lawlessness, free-for-all attitude, and do-as-you-please mentality are what make it so thrilling. Amidst a landscape characterized by a lack of regulation, rapid changes, and high uncertainty, the entrepreneurial spirit in the Wild Southeast thrives, fueled by a booming digital economy and favorable demographics.",
      "Picture the startup founders and venture capitalists as cowboys and outlaws, traversing the uncharted territory of the startup ecosystem. High risk, high reward, and a sense of adventure drive these pioneers, as they stake their claims in this digital gold rush. Regulators, however, are beginning to bring order to the chaos, working to create a more conducive environment for startups and VC firms to operate and grow. In this Wild, Wild Southeast, the entrepreneurial spirit is as alive as ever, and the opportunities are vast. The region’s booming digital economy and favorable demographics fuel the growth of the startup ecosystem, drawing entrepreneurs and investors alike to stake their claims in this digital gold rush. Here, the cowboys and outlaws of yesteryear take on new roles, with startup founders and venture capitalists navigating the lawlessness of the uncharted territory. Singapore emerges as a beacon of stability in this digital frontier, offering a stable legal and regulatory framework that attracts startups and investors from across the region. This orderliness has made Singapore the popular choice for holding companies and the base for many startups from countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. In this dynamic environment, roles often switch, with successful founders becoming LPs for VC funds and investors participating in venture building as founders. The culture of secrecy and competition in the Wild Southeast is reminiscent of the gold prospectors of the Wild West, with startup founders and venture capitalists keeping their ideas and business models closely guarded until the right moment to sell their “gold” to the highest bidder. However, not all that glitters is gold; sometimes, it’s just fool’s gold. The lack of transparency in accessing information, combined with practices such as “secret terms,” “non disclosure agreements,” and “no shop clauses,” creates an environment of mistrust that makes it difficult to evaluate the risks and potential of an investment. Information about private investments and the performance of startups is often kept confidential, especially for struggling startups in the growth stages. The stigma associated with startup failure is often fueled by concerns of adverse publicity and potential harm to a company’s reputation, which could obstruct further fundraising efforts.",
      "In Southeast Asia, where the startup landscape is still maturing, this apprehension is even more pronounced as failure might be perceived as an indictment of the entire ecosystem. Initial investors in a startup may prefer to withhold performance information to safeguard their own investments, leading to a lack of transparency that could impede both entrepreneurs and investors in making informed decisions and securing additional funds.",
      "In the Indonesian context, regulatory bodies often adopt a stance of cautious observation, which can be both advantageous and obstructive to the evolution of the startup environment. While such an approach initially allows regulators to scrutinize the sector and pinpoint areas requiring regulation, the resultant delays may hinder startups’ operations and investment attractiveness given the swift pace of the startup sector’s growth.",
      "As highlighted in a 2020 report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the regulatory shortfall in Indonesia’s venture capital and private equity space has made industry expansion challenging. The absence of clear rules and effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms curbs the growth of the startup ecosystem, as startups may struggle to acquire funding and scale their operations.",
      "Fortunately, the government is making headway by launching Indonesia Digital Economy Masterplan and the new policy on “Indonesia’s Omnibus Law on Job Creation.” These regulations aim to drive the country’s digital economy and create a conducive environment for startups. By easing regulations for businesses and improving the ease of doing business, the government is taking steps to foster the growth and development of the startup and VC investment ecosystem in the Wild Southeast.",
      "As the Wild, Wild Southeast continues to evolve, the fascinating interplay between cowboys and outlaws, founders and venture capitalists, and regulators and entrepreneurs creates a unique and exhilarating environment. However, it is important to tread with caution in this treacherous terrain. The region’s potential for growth and innovation is immense, but so are the risks and pitfalls that lie in wait. Post 2022, the landscape has been littered with casualties — the “greater fools” who misinterpreted the signals of downturns and underestimated the inherent dangers of the Wild Southeast. Remember, this book serves as a cautionary tale for those who venture into this untamed territory, unaware of the challenges that lie ahead.",
      "Never blame oneself for being a fool, because in investing, there will always be a ‘greater fool’ who will be more of a fool than you. Like buying assets (stocks, real estate, investment) at inflated prices to sell to a greater fool later at an even higher price. In financial markets, this kind of conjectural investment can create asset bubbles where the price of assets drastically deviates from their underlying value. This can induce unfounded enthusiasm among investors and cause an overestimation of certain industries or companies. Such a practice is still prevalent in the venture capital and startup sector, as investors are ready to pour substantial capital into nascent, high-risk startups in anticipation of eventually selling the company at a significantly higher valuation to another investor. This often results in startups being valued much higher than their actual worth, and the bubble bursts when investors begin to realize that the company is not performing as expected.",
      "The aspiration of striking it rich prompts entrepreneurs and investors to invest heavily into the region, frequently without an adequate assessment of the true value of these investments. This overconfidence, coupled with the anxiety of missing out, has set up a risky scenario where some investors and startups find themselves caught in a high-risk game of musical chairs.",
      "Once the bubble bursts and the music stops, those left without a chair face the consequences of their misguided investments, as illustrated by the examples of Zilingo, Sorabel, and an unworthy-to-even-be-mentioned-in-this-book agritech company… yes, the one starting with a “T”.",
      "The “Indonesian Dream” or “Southeast Asian Dream” may be an enticing prospect, but it is important for investors and entrepreneurs to not let their aspirations cloud their judgment. As we have seen from the stories of Zilingo, Sorabel, and the agri-tech company, the pursuit of this dream can lead to disastrous consequences for those who are unprepared or overly optimistic. The VC industry’s vulnerability to ego and greed can exacerbate these challenges, as professionals become more focused on their own success than on the well being of the startups they are supporting.",
      "Investors and entrepreneurs must remember that while the Southeast Asian market offers immense potential, it is not immune to the cycles of boom and bust that are prevalent in the global economy. The downturn in 2022 serves as a cautionary tale for those venturing into the Wild, Wild Southeast. It is crucial to approach investments with a realistic mindset, thoroughly analyze the intrinsic value of startups, and be prepared for the inevitable market corrections."

    "THE YEAR OF THE FOOL 🤡": [
      "COME on, who didn’t see it coming? The period of 2020-2021 brought about unprecedented changes to the global startup ecosystem. With lockdowns imposed across the globe, people were forced to adapt, and tech startups found themselves at the center of this “new normal.” The pandemic accelerated tech stocks through the roof and brought VC investment valuations to an all-time high. In hindsight, fund managers and startup founders reacted to this by doubling down on uncertainties for their own game. This led us to the peak of Web 2.0, or the apps era, where apps connected people who were staying at home during lockdown with their essential needs. In this section, I compare the pandemic’s impact on Southeast Asia’s tech startups and investors to the extinction event caused by the Chicxulub asteroid. As an early victim of Covid-19 in March 2020, I had ample time to analyze and write about the startup and VC industry during the global lockdown. In China, the value of VC deals plummeted, startups slashed jobs and salaries, and many hoped for government intervention to maintain liquidity. Meanwhile, tech investments in Southeast Asia had already fallen 36% in 2019.",
      "Startups that raised funds by disrupting consumer sectors like travel, transport, retail, and food delivery were massively disrupted by Covid-19. In order to survive, they had to adapt quickly to new realities. Health tech, edtech, and drone tech sectors showed signs of weathering the storm as they provided essential services and adapted to the changing environment.",
      "In the face of adversity, the stock market bounced back to all-time highs in late 2020 and 2021, thanks to government interventions, slashed interest rates, and the development of vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna. Stay-at-home stocks, or tech companies that benefited from the long-term trend of people staying at home, contributed significantly to this market surge.",
      "The pandemic and trade tensions between the US and China led to a record high capital outflow from China in 2020. Southeast Asia saw an influx of dry powder, which led to a record $9 billion in the region’s private equity market. As a result, Southeast Asia’s dry powder reached $10 to $14 billion by the end of 2020, with a significant portion going into growth-stage startups.",
      "The Indonesian government utilized fintech platforms for its Social Safety Net program, providing financial assistance to low-income households and individuals. The fintech industry in Indonesia attracted a total of $1.3 billion in investment in 2020, and digital transactions in the country increased by 44% that year.",
      "As China slept, Southeast Asia woke up to the sound of music, embracing new opportunities brought on by the pandemic and the influx of capital.",
      "The next wave of app business in Indonesia went into a portal of “temporary insanity” in terms of their valuations, focusing on everything stay-at-home mode from agritech to digibanks. The logic was this: while technology has become an integral part of our lives, it hasn’t solved all our problems. For example, relationships remain complicated, and divorce rates continue to climb. For example, the integration of technology with agriculture, a vital sector for human survival, is an interesting development. However, its potential remains uncertain. The pandemic highlighted the need for innovative solutions to improve the agricultural sector’s resilience and efficiency. Agritech startups have made some progress by offering precision farming, vertical farming, and blockchain based traceability systems. However, the industry is far from achieving its full potential. In Indonesia, the agritech industry has been too focused on middlemen, leading to monopolies and national food instability.",
      "Similarly, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine was not widely used, as most people preferred in-person consultations. However, with the pandemic overwhelming healthcare systems, people had no choice but to turn to digital health services. In Indonesia, healthtech startups experienced a surge in investment, but the sudden growth has also exposed several issues that need to be addressed. Limited internet access, lack of infrastructure, and an unclear regulatory framework could undermine patients’ trust in the system and hinder the growth of the industry. Furthermore, there is still a significant gap in the quality of healthcare services in Indonesia. Many patients with financial means still travel to Singapore and Malaysia for better treatment options. To truly benefit from the potential of healthtech, Indonesia needs more qualified professionals in areas like data science, artificial intelligence, and software development. The country’s healthcare system has much to improve, and while healthtech is ready to make a difference, there are still many challenges ahead.",
      "The rise of new sectors such as agritech and healthtech in 2021 drove excitement in tech startups in Indonesia, as investors and entrepreneurs alike saw the potential for innovation and growth.",
      "The rise of digibanks also played a significant role in the tech landscape during this period. As the pandemic forced consumers to shift towards digital channels, traditional banks had to adapt quickly and invest in digital banking solutions. In Indonesia, mobile banking usage is projected to reach around 1 billion users by 2025, with major players like Jenius and TMRW by UOB making significant strides.",
      "Interestingly, the surge in tech startups during this time was not limited to Southeast Asia. In fact, the global startup ecosystem experienced a similar uptick in activity. Y Combinator, a top global accelerator based in Silicon Valley, began valuing pre-product startups (those with only ideas) at a staggering $20 million in SAFE agreements. This new approach to valuing early stage startups represented a significant shift in the way investors and accelerators perceived the potential of these young companies. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on digital communication channels, such as video conferencing apps, meant that founders no longer had to travel to Y Combinator’s location in Mountain View, California, to interact face-to-face with mentors and angel investors. This shift towards remote collaboration not only eliminated geographical barriers but also democratized access to invaluable resources and networking opportunities for startups around the world.",
      "Entrepreneurs from various corners of the globe could now tap into the wealth of knowledge and experience offered by Y Combinator’s network, without the need for physical presence. This increased accessibility further fueled the rapid growth and development of the global startup ecosystem, contributing to the rise of promising ventures in diverse sectors, including those in Southeast Asia. This phenomenon reached a global scale, with teenage entrepreneurs receiving seed funding from reputable investors for their innovative ideas.",
      "Back home, tech giants such as Gojek and SEA Group acquired banking licenses, while fintech companies like FundingSocieties and Investree gained stakes in traditional banks. This convergence of industries demonstrates the growing trend of digital banking in Indonesia and the potential for collaboration between traditional banks, fintech companies, and tech players.",
      "In 2021, the rise of crypto exchanges and the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency further transformed the tech sector in Indonesia. Crypto startups, NFT marketplaces, and play-to-earn platforms attracted significant investment, as did crypto brokerage platforms like Pintu and Nansen. Another trend that emerged was the rise of embedded finance, which integrates financial services into non-financial products and services. Companies like Chime, Varo, Affirm, and Afterpay are at the forefront of this movement, with Southeast Asian e-commerce and ride-hailing companies like Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Gojek, and Grab also adopting embedded finance in their business models.",
      "However, the pinnacle of 2021’s excitement in the tech landscape was arguably the highly anticipated IPO race among Indonesia’s unicorns. The public was eagerly anticipating which firm would be the first to launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO): Bukalapak, which initially positioned itself as an e-commerce competitor to Tokopedia before pivoting to become the largest offline-to-online ‘partner’ model, or the newly fused Gojek and Tokopedia, now called GoTo, offering an array of services such as ride-sharing, food delivery, and e-commerce. The tech unicorn’s IPO is often perceived as a landmark event in the industry, and it was no different in this instance.",
      "For Indonesia’s startup sector, which is still maturing, a unicorn company’s IPO marked a significant milestone. I can’t help but get excited to view this event as a notable one in the history of the ecosystem. The company raised a record of $1.5 billion, and dubbed it as the country’s largest-ever public offering.",
      "I have to admit: that was one fine day for the ecosystem. This achievement set a new precedent in the Indonesian stock market. Within just two months of being listed, Bukalapak was included in five indexes: IDX30, LQ45, IDX80, JII, and JII70. This was a gargantuan feat, considering it had never been done before. SEA, the first unicorn tech company in ASEAN, was listed on the NYSE in 2017. Now, the IDX has made it possible for non-profitable startups like Bukalapak to list on the main board, rather than the development board. Bukalapak’s IPO reinvigorated interest in IDX stocks, attracting an influx of millennial and Gen Z investors and breaking down barriers for tech startups in Indonesia. For a while, I recall that everyone from stockbrokers, traders, and investment bankers to neighbors and even my son’s high school friends were asking about BUKA and other pre-IPO Indonesian tech stocks. It was a total bliss! The enthusiasm surrounding Bukalapak’s IPO served as a testament to the potential of the tech landscape in Indonesia, signaling a bright future for the industry and its stakeholders. As these excitement continue to grow during the “new normal,” the tech landscape in Indonesia seems likely to experience further growth and innovation, with the potential for even greater disruption in the years to come. But we all know the aftermath of this in the 2022 crisis, an unchecked craze and the practice of the greater fool can lead to severe consequences. To foster sustainable growth in emerging sectors, it is vital for both investors and businesses to maintain a discerning approach, focusing on innovation, long term value creation, and genuine problem-solving, rather than merely riding the wave of hype.",

  "CHAPTER FOUR: THE FALLACY OF BOOM": {
    "THE FALLACY": [
      "COVID-19 knocked the wind out of our sails, yet the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem proved resilient, showing a strong rebound in growth in 2021. Tech in Asia reported a total funding of $4.1 billion in Q2 2021, surpassing the full-year total of $3.3 billion funding deals in 2020.",
      "In the face of the ever-changing “new normal,” several previously dormant sectors saw a significant uptick in activity, driven by the pandemic-induced changes in our behaviors and lifestyles. E-commerce, healthtech, online education, and digital entertainment all experienced rapid growth, as people adapted to new ways of living, working, and interacting. As a result, 2021 saw an impressive surge in VC funding in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia leading the pack. However, despite the booming market, challenges remained, including a lack of developed exit options for investors and a need for more experienced technical founders. In this ever-evolving landscape, it is crucial for investors to focus not only on the next promising tech vertical but also on the visionaries leading the charge. Exceptional founders and management teams have the rare ability to pivot, adapt, and succeed in the face of challenges and changing market conditions. By prioritizing the talent, leadership, and resilience of the individuals behind startups, investors can identify the true game-changers and the most lucrative opportunities.",
      "Navigating the unique challenges of the Indonesian market is essential for foreign investors looking to tap into the country’s rapidly growing tech sector. Strong local partnerships are key to overcoming regulatory hurdles and understanding the intricacies of Indonesia’s cultural norms, customs, and consumer behaviors.",
      "However, the boom cycle is often accompanied by a false sense of security, as people are intoxicated by the thrill of seemingly endless growth. The belief that economic prosperity can continue indefinitely without interruption is the fallacy of the boom. The reality is that, just as passionate love can fade over time, so too can the euphoria of a booming market. As government interventions and temporary stimulus measures phased out, the market began to feel the effects of a downturn in 2022. The end of the pandemic did not necessarily guarantee a swift return to pre-pandemic conditions. Overvaluation of certain stocks and sectors led to market corrections, as investors sought to exit before it was too late.",
      "The illusion associated with the boom phase arises from the negligence of underlying economic issues that could potentially trigger a recession. In times of prosperity, business might accrue excessive debt or invest in overpriced assets, thereby rendering them vulnerable. Such circumstances would raise doubts of the idea of “smart money”, and recent events have demonstrated that the effectiveness of a private fund such as VC isn’t solely determined by its AUM alone, but its capacity to strategically utilize its capital. This revised viewpoint has catalyzed a reassessment of success indicators and a recalibration of anticipations of the industry, as no one is beyond the reach of failure, regardless of size. Previously, large funds with substantial AUM were often perceived as lead and somewhat “safe” investments to follow, but the past year had taught us all that even the most sizable funds can succumb to failure, a huge one too.",
      "Tech is called tech because it promises rapid pace of change and innovation, adaptation and evolution; this is the only way to measure its success.",
      "Whenever I hear there’s a boom in the industry, I want to immediately cut debts, save capital, and implement policies that address structural issues in the economy. Ideally, in such circumstances, policymakers should be aware of the potential for a recession and take steps to mitigate the effects of a downturn. However, we can’t always rely on other people to do our own homework."
    ],
    "THE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE": [
      "IN late 2020, I penned a guest column in Forbes Indonesia titled “Are We Headed for a Supermassive Black Hole?” At the time, I believed the pandemic would end soon, and we’d enter a correction year in 2021. However, the pandemic continued, with the Delta variant hitting Indonesia even harder. I hope to convey the sense of worry I felt in 2021 about what might come in 2022 as we ‘postponed’ the correction. Back in the first half of 2020, many tech industry commentators thought that the Covid-19 pandemic would serve as a black swan event, with clear winners and losers emerging in the following months. We based our assumptions on the belief that governments worldwide would quickly control this once-in-a-century pandemic, similar to how Asian markets rebounded within a year of the SARS outbreak in 2003.",
      "However, subsequent waves of infections reversed the recovery progress from earlier waves (in terms of stock markets, employment, and even SMEs rebuilding at the street level). We now understand that the timeline for a genuine recovery for startups and VC in Indonesia must be extended by at least a year -- an unbearable wait for many players. Singapore-based Cento Ventures released headline data of tech investments across the region for 1H2020. As anticipated, both the total deals and the value of deals declined (15% and 13%, respectively) compared to 1H2019. Southeast Asia as a whole recorded $5.6 billion worth of deals, spanning more than 300 fundraising rounds.",
      "The question arises: what does this mean for the startup and venture community in Southeast Asia? Are there truly any clear winners and losers? Is the regional VC community skating on thin ice, oblivious to the cracks forming? It’s essential to note that deals completed in the first half of 2020 were negotiated during the tail-end of 2019, and Southeast Asia didn’t see its first few Covid-19 fatalities until the second quarter. Pandemic-related lockdowns only began in earnest during Q2. Could we gain better insight by examining more recent deal-making data?",
      "Indonesia recorded its first few Covid-19 startup casualties in early March 2020. Since then, aside from a ‘meaningful’ undisclosed investment by WhatsApp and PayPal into Indonesian super-app Gojek in early June that year, investors stopped pouring money into Indonesia’s previously popular e-commerce sector. Travel and tourism startups were decimated by numerous lockdowns and closed borders. Indonesian travel unicorn Traveloka proved to be the lone bright spot, securing a ‘top-up’ of $250 million in funding from existing investors — although at a valuation that was 17% lower than pre-Covid rounds. E-commerce casualties like Stoqo, which supplied fresh ingredients to food outlets, and fashion startup Sorabel burned through cash quickly to stay afloat — but their typical six-month runways proved insufficient for outlasting the crisis.",
      "For smaller companies still on a growth trajectory and amassing user bases in these two sectors, investor reticence led to two distinct outcomes: fundamental change or death. In the tourism tech space, hotel and room booking company Airy Rooms and property management startup Travelio took different routes: Airy Rooms shut down entirely at the end of May, while Travelio quickly pivoted to grocery delivery, launching Travelio Mart for its tenants in the same month. As one of the few outliers, Bobobox, which manages capsule hotels, raised $11.5 million in late May 2020. The startup introduced long-stay packages for students and employees, including food catering. Its pivot captured a new user segment: students and workers who use Bobobox hotels due to proximity to work or college and fast connectivity. Major regional funds and corporate VCs, who had long seen e-commerce and travel tech sectors as no-brainer plays on Indonesia’s growing middle-class population, witnessed some of their marquee investments go bust, with any hopes of returns evaporating. A quick snapshot of deals in the first half of the year shows that VCs have pivoted, too. Where they used to plow money into B2C apps, the main focus now is on B2B -- a largely untapped niche aimed at digitizing the operations of hundreds of millions of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across Indonesia’s archipelago. Apart from e-marketplaces connecting wholesale sellers or farmers with SME buyers, we are also seeing capital go to e-commerce adjacent startups like PasarPolis. The platform offers insurance products against damaged e-commerce goods, protection for gig workers like delivery couriers, and more.",
      "Agritech, as expected, has drawn more investor attention due to the focus on fresh ingredients and secure supply chains to bolster food security. Supporting these are related payments and logistics verticals like supply chain financing and credit management apps. With investors giving more attention to startups in the B2B niche, we are also seeing more measured investment volumes and more emphasis on sustainable margins. This could soon displace the cash burning race of the past, which had startups chasing growth at all costs, with no clear path to profitability. Surprisingly, the global investor interest in edtech and healthtech during Covid-19 was not replicated in Indonesia. While the pandemic forced Indonesian schools to shut down in March, only two local edtech startups announced fundraising rounds. The niches these edtech players operate in also shine a light on important issues with the nation’s online education space at large, such as weak connectivity, inadequate digital infrastructure, and many local users, quite simply, being unwilling or unable to pay. A May 2020 report by the World Bank found that Indonesian edtech startups depend on the freemium model to attract new users, but less than 3% of them convert to paid versions, with both educators and students preferring that subscriptions be borne by educational institutions or the government. So investors are seeding startups like Pintek, which is essentially a fintech startup that restructures student loans into more manageable payments; or Codemi, which banks on companies paying for online employee training modules. Both of these address existing gaps in the education and skills e learning pipeline, with clear paths to revenue and profitability.",
      "The majority of Indonesians still depend on public hospitals and clinics for their healthcare needs. Healthtech startups in Indonesia have not recorded new funding rounds since the outbreak, having closed large funding rounds in 2019 and showing no urgent need for ‘top-ups’ due to Indonesian dependence on government facilities. Contrast this to healthtech startups in neighboring Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Singapore, where the private sector has a bigger bite of the healthcare pie. In April, Malaysian employee wellness startup Naluri raised $1.1 million, while Singapore’s remote consultation app DoctorAnywhere raised $27 million in March of 2020.",
      "In Indonesia, the investor pivot from B2C e-commerce marketplaces to hyper local niche B2B startups reflects the country’s digitization disparity. Indonesia is home to the fourth-highest number of Facebook users and 3.5 million mom and-pop shops that account for 70% of fast-moving consumer goods retail transactions.",
      "In the post-pandemic investing era, investors can no longer hang their hats and hopes on a single sector or market. Being aware of local nuances allows investors to find strong growth startups with clear paths to profitability. Not only does going hyper-local bode well for the short term, as social distancing becomes the norm, but also in the long term. It helps clarify how close to exit or maturity investments can really be from the get-go, rather than depending on the see saw of hype-based valuations. And if VCs and startups can’t get on the same page, what I once predicted as a Darwinian black swan event may actually prove to be a supermassive black hole, from which there’s no escape.",
      "At the center of this dark gravity, I wagered that the first casualty would be the fintech P2P lending sector. The best time during the lockdown was when you had ample time at your disposal to write and predict what would transpire in this once-in-a-lifetime event. Continuing from my previous guest column in Forbes Indonesia, I’ve also written another piece for the publisher that probes into the potential pitfalls of the fintech P2P lending industry, inspired by the crisis in the Chinese P2P market. In this subsequent column, I explore the possibility of a similar fate for the P2P lending ecosystem in Southeast Asia, while also highlighting the silver linings and successful examples of P2P lending players. Perhaps in order to play the role of a clairvoyant, we examined the P2P lending failures in China beginning in 2018. In light of these failures, as well as those in the US, Southeast Asia’s SMEs must transition to a more sustainable model of microfinancing before it’s too late.",
      "Indonesia’s P2P lending ecosystem experienced rapid growth over the last three years, bringing with it hopeful investors and a silver lining to the country’s SME economy. This explosive growth has also kept regulators, like the Financial Services Authority (OJK), on high alert in terms of distinguishing valuable companies from those that are risk laden and often illegal, promising high returns to investors. According to a 2018 report by KPMG, Indonesia’s P2P lending industry grew over 800% since 2016, with over IDR 25 trillion in loans disbursed by the end of 2018. Given the hype surrounding P2P lending, it would be prudent for investors to examine more mature markets for patterns and hold back from putting their money on the line until the dust settles. The rise and fall of the P2P lending economy have repeated itself twice already; first in China, and later in the United States. However, unlike in China or the US, P2P lending is not a new concept in Indonesia. Usaha patungan, or the act of collectively contributing to a neighbor’s business, has been a common practice for centuries. This cultural difference plays a crucial role in the growth of Indonesia’s P2P lending ecosystem. The familiarity with microfinance makes it easier for both lenders and borrowers to adapt to new models introduced by entrepreneurs. Indonesia has another kind of economy not recorded in any ledgers, one written in the hearts of the people. Local wisdom 101.",
      "On one hand, the ready adoption of P2P lending by Indonesia’s underbanked population fuels the growth of this ecosystem. On the other hand, the lack of regulation surrounding this growth poses high risks for everyone involved, including investors, lenders, and borrowers. The absence of accurate credit scoring methods and insufficient capital for debt refinancing make it incredibly challenging for P2P lenders to properly vet borrowers and guarantee investors their promised rate of return. High non-performing loan (NPL) rates of above 3% are common. According to a list released on September 30, 2019, only 13 out of the 127 registered lending applications have been licensed by OJK. Outside of the roughly 100 that are registered, hundreds more operate illegally in the archipelago. These illegal P2P lending platforms have caused alarming scandals, such as insolvency, absurd interest rates, and dubious collection methods, triggering resistance movements from former borrowers. On the investor side, numerous cases exist where P2P lending platforms in China have defaulted after shutting down, leaving investors with no way to withdraw their investments.",
      "Given the nightmarish track record of P2P lending platforms in China and America, it is inevitable that a P2P lending apocalypse will spread in Southeast Asia sooner or later.",
      "That said, some P2P players in this region are not out to scam you. Those that have managed to offer lasting value serve as examples of how to transition to a more sustainable microfinancing ecosystem. These players usually operate within a specific niche, such as invoice financing or financing SMEs within the e-commerce sector. A case in point is Danamas, part of the Sinarmas group, which exclusively deals with borrowers who are either Traveloka customers or who require mobile phone credit. With a low default rate and 14% to 20% returns, Danamas was the first P2P lender in Indonesia to be fully registered and licensed by the OJK. Part of its success can be attributed to its integration within the financial ecosystem. Borrowers can open a Sinarmas Bank account, purchase mobile credit, and even buy insurance through the app, all backed by an entity within the formal financial sector. Even if P2P lending is a ticking time bomb, it has nonetheless contributed to the development of the financial sector in Indonesia.",
      "Smart P2P lending startups understand that they will need to diversify if they hope to survive as the fittest. This is Darwinism in its purest form. I’ve witnessed some of these companies demonstrate interesting new use cases to the formal financial sector already in Indonesia. New P2P lending platforms are showing that they can tap into opportunities the big banks cannot.",
      "Investree is one such example. The company started out by making a compelling case for invoice financing, particularly in the creative industry where physical collateral is still hard to come by. At the same time, P2P lending startup Modalku has been showing traction with online merchant financing and even trade financing (e.g., supply chain financing). These lateral opportunities were born from P2P lending and likely have long-term value to big banks and formal financial institutions in ASEAN. But they will need a new model such as a potential merger to become digibanks. According to the World Bank global financial index, 48.9% of Indonesian adults own a bank account, while only 17.3% have borrowed from a formal financial institution. Compare this to the country’s 72.4% internet penetration rate for urban areas, where SMEs are most often located, and there is a glaring gap between the two statistics. P2P lending applications have provided a way to bridge this chasm by conditioning mobile-first consumers to conduct financial activity online.",
      "In other words, P2P lending technologies help disseminate unbanked populations to the idea of microfinancing, thus increasing the rate of financial literacy in Indonesia. This is especially true after the OJK passed a regulation in 2016 requiring P2P lending platforms to provide external seminars and dissemination programs to promote financial inclusion and literacy in the market. As I mentioned earlier, P2P players that bring use cases to the formal financial sector will be the ones who lead the way in the market. Licensed P2P lenders are likely to survive as they are already integrated within the formal financial sector and fill a specific niche. However, the same cannot be said for the hundreds of unlicensed P2P lending businesses currently operating in Indonesia, as they will be driven to collapse by an unsustainable business model.",
      "Lain lubuk, lain ilalang — different pool, different grass, as the local saying goes. What happens in China and the US does not always replicate in this region. The health of the industry can be gauged by the rate of NPLs, and as such, it would be wise to keep an eye on the canary in the coal mine for the time being."

    "WHEN VC MONEY MEETS REAL MONEY": [
      "WITH all the hype and chatter surrounding local IPOs, ASEAN’s tech stock investors are faced with a challenge to separate signal from noise. VCs can provide valuable insight in such cases.",
      "The Southeast Asian tech scene has grown significantly in recent years, and it’s just the beginning. Homegrown tech giants are going public, and a deal-making boom is well underway. VCs are no longer selling mere stories of theoretical valuations and potential liquidity. The Indonesian e-commerce platform Bukalapak went public, becoming the country’s first listed tech unicorn. The f irm raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, valuing the company at $6 billion. With more IPOs expected, institutional investors need to be ready.",
      "The tech industry was bolstered by the pandemic, with social distancing pushing people to look for online alternatives. Many internet users in Southeast Asia began using new digital services due to the pandemic. Examples of tech companies going public include Decacorn GoTo’s plan to be listed on IDX and Grab’s SPAC listing in the United States. However, they are not the only ones considering going public. Rising firms like PropertyGuru, Carousell, Ninja Van, Carro, and Ryde are eyeing IPOs as well. Many capital market investors are concerned about the overall lack of profitability in these companies, leading to speculation of a Southeast Asian tech bubble. However, tech companies typically record more than 20% YoY exponential growth rates, with profitability taking a backseat to growth. VCs play a crucial role in educating institutional investors about the tech industry, with their insider knowledge and extensive experience with startups. They need to actively approach institutional investors and consider the bigger picture of having tech-savvy institutional investors in the ASEAN region. The growing popularity of SPACs among tech companies is due to their ability to bypass some procedures required in a traditional IPO, cutting costs and time. SPACs have become increasingly popular in the tech industry, with companies like Robinhood, Coinbase, Roblox, and Instacart going public through SPACs. This trend is also happening in Southeast Asia, with Grab announcing a SPAC deal, and other companies considering the same route.",
      "Nonetheless, proceeding to become a publicly traded company via a SPAC presents potential hazards for both the SPAC and the target entity. These risks include inadequate transparency, a possibility of insider trading, and investors lacking influence over the acquired firm’s choice. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been closely examining the use of SPACs and has proposed new regulations aimed at enhancing transparency and mandating more rigorous disclosure requirements.",
      "Market corrections are natural and expected occurrences after a period of sustained growth and high valuations. The past couple of years have seen intense hype in the high-tech industry, followed by concerns about the stability of financial institutions. The boom is typically fueled by optimism and greed, which drives people to spend more and heat up the economy. Then the Central Bank's respond by raising interest rates, making loans more expensive and causing people to spend less, making businesses less profitable. Market corrections help realign valuations and stock prices with the underlying fundamentals of companies, preventing market bubbles. The tech industry is particularly vulnerable to the boom and bust cycle due to its dynamic nature and the scale of the companies involved. This period of market correction is supposed to be an opportunity for anyone, especially large corporations and laggards to catch up with the market and understand the cycle of tech innovation. It’s the right time to move in and adapt to the ever-evolving tech landscape in Southeast Asia."
    ],
    "CRUMBLING OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS (PART 2)": [
      "AS I look back on my 10 years in the startup ecosystem, I realize how the excitement of Southeast Asia’s glorified IPOs of Bukalapak and Grab may have influenced my perspective. In this chapter, I want to revisit my guest columns on these two companies, which I thought would mark the pinnacle of Indonesia’s tech IPO success. But as events unfolded, we learned that the end of one cycle was just the beginning of another.",
      "My writings on Grab and Bukalapak highlight the significance of these IPOs in the region. Grab’s choice of the SPAC route signaled a new era of exit strategies for tech giants, while Bukalapak’s listing on IDX marked the first Indonesian tech unicorn to go public. However, we need to recognize that these successes do not represent the endgame, but rather a milestone in the ever-evolving startup ecosystem. Revisiting my guest columns allows us to reflect on the lessons learned and the ongoing challenges that startup founders and investors face. As we celebrate these IPOs, we must also acknowledge the potential risks associated with high valuations and rapid growth. The end of one cycle is an opportunity to learn from past experiences and adapt our strategies for future growth.",
      "The columns on Grab and Bukalapak showcase the importance of understanding market dynamics and the different perspectives of investors. While value investors may see these companies as overvalued, momentum investors focus on their potential for exponential growth. As more tech companies go public, it’s crucial for investors and stakeholders to recognize the unique characteristics of the tech sector and adapt their strategies accordingly. Fast forward back to 2022, the market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has slowed significantly, with proceeds down almost 50% and global IPO volumes also down about 50%. This follows a record year for companies going public in 2021, when there were 2,500 public debuts globally and approximately $400 billion was raised. Many high-growth businesses have delayed going public or chose not to due to less favorable market conditions. The Renaissance Capital IPO index is down 45% year-to-date, while some individual companies have seen declines of 50-70% from their issuance prices or highs.",
      "The current market activity is less favorable to growth stocks, hence the slowdown in IPO activity. Companies go public to raise capital for growth but with valuations collapsing the wiser choice is to delay IPO plans. Some investors who bought newly public companies in recent years may feel disappointment over their growth status. With every season turn, turn, turn, my granddad used to sing. It’s clear now that the only way to bring the excitement back is when any (if not all) of these unicorns reach their profitability. According to their press releases, 2023 is a critical year for these companies, as it will determine whether they can achieve operating profits, a milestone that would significantly impact their trajectories and the overall investment environment in Southeast Asia. This “make or break” moment for these three giants is being closely watched by investors, as their success or failure will have ripple effects throughout the region’s startup ecosystem. If Grab, Goto, and Bukalapak succeed in posting operating profits, it will not only validate the faith placed in them by their investors but also serve as an example for other startups in the region. Should these companies succeed, they might inspire more investors to back startups in Southeast Asia, bringing vital capital and resources into the ecosystem. This could stimulate innovation, job creation, and economic expansion across the region.",
      "Conversely, if these companies fall short of their earnings targets, it may cast a cold shadow over the region’s startup investment environment. Investors could become more guarded in their approach, being more prudent with their investments and opting for a more conservative investment strategy. This might escalate the difficulty for startups in the region to obtain the necessary funding for growth and innovation.",
      "Now, let us examine the burn rate and the rationale behind it, starting with Bukalapak, Indonesia’s first unicorn company that went public. According to their FY 2022 report, Bukalapak’s revenue increased by an impressive 94% YoY, and the company achieved a positive overall contribution margin, improving from -1.1% in 2021 to -0.6% in 2022. Startup boasts a robust capital position, with $1.5 billion in cash and liquid investments, providing an estimated runway of 50 years. However, it is important to note that most of the profits were derived from unrealized gains on investments. Thus, it will be crucial to monitor Bukalapak’s 2023 performance to determine its potential impact on the local ecosystem. Similarly, Grab, which I refer to as the driving force behind the region’s startup ecosystem, has demonstrated significant progress in its financial performance. In their FY 2022 report, Grab revealed a remarkable 64% YoY reduction in losses. As a result, the company’s adjusted EBITDA break even guidance has been brought forward to the fourth quarter of 2023 from the previously projected second half of 2024. This accelerated timeline highlights Grab’s commitment to achieving profitability and further solidifying its position as a leader in the region’s startup ecosystem."

  "CHAPTER FIVE: THE TALE OF TWO VENTURES": {
    "THE TALE": [
      "IN early 2014, I was invited by Telkom Indonesia to work with Indigo Incubator, a program that provided SAFE-like grants to startups in exchange for less than 10% shares. The grant ranged from IDR 100 million to IDR 1 billion, depending on the startups’ development stages. My work over the past decade has centered on introducing and re-introducing VC investment in Indonesia, and 2022 marked an era where we revisited the past industry’s theses on investment in technology and ecosystem development.",
      "In the early days of corporate venture firms in Indonesia, the VC landscape was l buzzing with excitement about the potential of CVCs to bridge the gap between early stage and later-stage investments. Telkom Indonesia recognized this opportunity and brought my team and I, who were fresh from our experience at Systec Ventures, to establish MDI Ventures. This was a significant move, as many VCs were eager to partner with corporate venture funds and tap into our experience through collaborations.",
      "At the outset, the relationship between CVCs and early stage VCs was mutually beneficial. CVCs were unable to place bets on extremely early deals, relying instead on early stage VCs to “feed” them a pipeline of startups that aligned with their investment thesis and risk appetite. This dynamic not only helped CVCs identify potential deals but also allowed them to gauge and better manage their risk.",
      "As the corporate venture landscape in Indonesia evolved, so too did the relationship between CVCs and early stage VCs. The once symbiotic dynamic began to change, with some CVCs competing directly with early stage VCs for deals. This shift created tension within the ecosystem and highlighted the growing importance and influence of CVCs in Indonesia’s startup landscape. Despite these challenges, I feel that the lesson for CVC must continue within the realm of corporate, especially state-owned. The knowledge that we’ve accumulated so far must continue to make strides in the world of CVC, and for that the next move would be co-founding another CVC—BRI Ventures—with Bank Rakyat Indonesia. Different thesis, but continuing the lesson learned. This new venture brought its own set of unique experiences, challenges, and successes, adding to the author’s wealth of knowledge and further shaping the tale of two venture funds. Indonesia’s state-owned corporations were fortunate to have Indra Utoyo, who served as Chief of Innovation and Strategy of Telkom Indonesia (2007-2017) and Managing Director of IT and Digital at Bank Rakyat Indonesia (2017 2022). Despite warnings of impending disruption since the late 90s and the dot-com boom, many in large corporations like Telkom Indonesia found it difficult to believe in the reality of such change. Even today, some in the banking industry refuse to accept fintech’s disruptive potential. Utoyo has been a significant figure in the digital transformation of state-owned corporations. During his early days at Telkom, he explained that his focus on digital initiatives stemmed from the company’s lack of attention to the sector. Telkom Indonesia’s primary revenue stream came from its cellular division, with digital being merely a “good to-have” segment. Utoyo was able to explore and experiment with venture building activities for almost a decade without interruption. However, not everyone could succeed in his position; many would have failed or even requested to be transferred to a more “prosperous” segment of the business. In my years of knowing Utoyo, he has proven to be one of the most curious individuals in the entire state-owned organization. His child-like behavior allowed him to meet fascinating people in the industry, from Jack Ma to Mark Zuckerberg. I believe it is this sense of curiosity that has driven him to continue exploring and innovating. Indigo Incubator, Utoyo’s brainchild program for Telkom Indonesia, was established in 2011 to anticipate a new wave of entrepreneurs in the era of digital companies in Indonesia. This program set a precedent for what was to come from state-owned entities. Later, we would see incubator programs emerging from state-owned companies such as PLN, Pertamina, and Pos Indonesia, from 2016 until today. These programs highlighted the growing recognition of the importance of nurturing and supporting innovative startups in the digital age. BEING THE FIRST OF ITS KIND “IT’S hard when you’ve been working in digital initiatives for almost a decade and then some new guys come along and tell you that everything you’ve been doing is wrong,” said one Telkom Indonesia’s executives, explaining to me the early conflicts that had been happening between internal Telkom and its first corporate venture initiative. But the truth is, we didn’t just get here dragged by the currents; one incident is always a response to a situation, something for the young guns to ponder.",
      "Digital platforms and e-commerce have changed how we date, shop, eat, plan, learn, medicate, and more. The tsunami of disruption altered the traditional way of doing things. Uber, Alibaba, Facebook, and Airbnb all connected wants and needs, supplies and demands, without owning the traditional assets of their industries.",
      "Disruption can be good or bad; only time and adaptation will tell. It forces us to reexamine and come up with new rules. The telecommunications industry was one of the first to be disrupted by technology. They used to be the high rollers, until Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gave them a taste of their own medicine, turning them into “dumb pipes.” Telcos weren’t going to sit and look pretty while others took their market share. Telkom Indonesia transformed into an investment holding company, buying other telco companies to diversify revenue streams and maintain a strong foothold in the market. They refused to let another VoIP slip past their radar without being a part of it or owning it. In the early 2010s, Telkom Indonesia launched various initiatives like Plasa.com, USeeTV, and UZone. The idea for MDI Ventures was coined in early 2015, when the concept of follow-on funding was still uncommon in Indonesia’s startup investment landscape. We wanted balance between returns and immediate portfolio construction impact.",
      "Collaboration is key, and investing in startups around the globe opens many possibilities. We build collectives to foster knowledge sharing, better understand the global market, identify new trends and opportunities, and better position our portfolio companies to compete on a global scale. At MDI Ventures, we had a clear investment philosophy that guides our decision-making process, focusing on ‘Now,’ ‘New,’ and ‘Next’ investments. We prioritized proven business models with healthy unit economics, new and innovative approaches to problem-solving, and companies operating in industries that are in the early stages of development but have a clear vision for the future.",
      "Our geographical focus spread out not only in Indonesia, but the APAC region, and our investment mantra was: Access, Upside, and Impact. Our edge was engagement with Telkom Indonesia and other corporate partners. We invested strategically and focused on balancing financial gain and immediate impact through collaboration in our portfolio construction.",
      "One of the things that we learned was that cash-poor companies only yield poor synergy performance, so we avoided them. We have to speak the same language, which is one of the reasons I wrote this book — so we can be on the same page.",
      "Corporate funding is typically considered “patient capital,” but state-owned corporations can be subject to “impatient capital” due to corporate political pressures. I experienced similar challenges when leading the first CVC arm of Telkom Indonesia. Despite the achievements of MDI Ventures, the game of corporate VC is still widely misunderstood within the organization today. This highlights the importance of education and awareness about VC and its role in driving innovation and growth.",
      "Three key factors contribute to a successful investment strategy: access to money, investing in strategic rounds of funding, and mitigating risk by diversifying investments across multiple geographic locations and sectors. Never limit yourself to specific ecosystems; be agile and adaptable, exploring opportunities beyond the confines of a single region or industry. This flexibility not only allows us to identify promising startups across various sectors but also gives us the ability to respond to changing market conditions and invest in the most promising trends.",
      "In the end, CVC, like any other investment, is about balancing risk and reward. It’s crucial to maintain a long term perspective and recognize that not every investment will yield immediate results. Patience is essential, as the journey to success can be filled with ups and downs, twists and turns. To maintain a healthy portfolio, it’s crucial to continuously evaluate and reassess your investments. Many VCs refer to this process as tracking progress, identifying areas for improvement, and making informed decisions based on the evolving landscape. However, my strategy for surviving in state-owned CVCs is quite simple: stay vigilant. The environment is often fraught with challenges, both from internal and external sources. I realized from day one that it’s a dog-eat-dog type of world; if you fail, they will blame you for it, and if successful, then the rest will piggyback on the trophies.",
      "By staying vigilant, you can ensure that your investments are well-positioned for success. Risk mitigation discipline is the key to success if you want to be successful running a CVC fund. My philosophy is called the “Realistic Return Threshold” or RTT. This is a pragmatic model of return expectation that emphasizes conservative or realistic projections of investment returns, as opposed to overly optimistic estimates that might be “too good to be true.” We will discuss more about RTT in the later segments of this chapter.",
      "It’s also important to remember that liquidity is scarce in this type of investment. You can wait for IPOs, but it would take 8 to 10 years if you’re a seed or early stage investor, and 4-6 years if you’re a growth stage investor. The challenge lies in the fact that most of the parent company’s board members serve terms of only 3-5 years, with a few exceptions lasting close to 10 years. New board members bring new ways of doing things and new agendas. As a subsidiary, it’s difficult to maneuver quickly enough to cater to one or two board members who may not fully understand the industry or the intricacies of your work.",
      "Given these challenges, the importance of maintaining a solid risk mitigation strategy cannot be overstated. In an ever-changing corporate landscape, the ability to adapt to new challenges and seize opportunities as they arise is essential. This approach fosters resilience and ensures that the organization remains prepared for any potential obstacles on the path to success.",
      "To thrive in such an environment, it’s crucial to establish open communication channels and continuously educate stakeholders about the investment landscape and the long term nature of VC investments. By fostering a culture of transparency and understanding, you can better align your goals with those of the parent company and navigate the complexities of working with changing leadership dynamics. MDI Ventures’ journey is far from over. Even when I left the company in 2019 to continue with BRI Ventures, I realized that some of the strong foundations and discipline weren’t enough as we’ve learned in the aftermath of the global crisis a few years later down the road. Although, as the first of its kind, MDI Ventures continued to demonstrate to other corporations, state-owned or otherwise, the importance of digital transformation, and how embracing change, fostering collaboration, and a forward-thinking approach to tech investment can lead to the sustainability of the organization. As I transitioned to BRI Ventures, I brought with me the lessons learned and the best practices from my time at MDI Ventures. The challenges posed by the global crisis only reinforced the need for organizations to be more agile and innovative in the face of uncertainty. It was evident that the corporate landscape was changing, and those who were unwilling or unable to adapt would risk being left behind."

    "LOCAL WISDOM 101": [
      "IN 2017, a flurry of fintech companies made headlines by securing consecutive funding rounds, and more money was poured into the nation’s fintech sector. Additionally, more e-commerce companies began transitioning into embedded finance companies, equipped with their own e-wallets, credit scoring, lending capabilities, and other tools aimed at making finance more inclusive. A popular headline at the time proclaimed that your next banker could be your Gojek driver, reflecting the emergence of new players in the financial services industry. The main principle thesis of the CVC continues: “money has to work strategically for startups,” emphasizing the importance of strategic use of money in supporting startups through smart investments. With this in mind, I began exploring the idea of establishing a fintech fund backed by a bank, specifically one with a focus on financial inclusion and microfinancing. This philosophy led me to approach Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the largest bank in Indonesia in terms of assets and the biggest microfinancing bank in the world, to collaborate on an investment thesis. Our goal was to align with their new transformation agenda, aiming to make them the most valuable banking group in Southeast Asia. Through this collaboration, we sought to leverage Bank Rakyat Indonesia’s resources, including its vast network, expertise, and market knowledge, to help identify and nurture promising fintech startups. By working together, we could provide startups with not just capital, but also access to a wide range of banking and financial services, as well as the opportunity to gain valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by the financial services industry in Indonesia. Ultimately, our goal was to support the growth of the fintech ecosystem in Indonesia while also supporting Bank Rakyat Indonesia achieving its ambitious transformation agenda.",
      "BRI Ventures was established in late 2019, building on the learning thesis of risk mitigation, ensuring liquidity, and adopting a moderate risk-moderate return strategy. The company aimed to offer a safer round of financing compared to the high risk-high return nature of an “early” round of financing. The year 2019 witnessed a surge in the number of fintech companies in Indonesia and Southeast Asia that had begun to mature since 2016, providing ample opportunities for BRI Ventures to explore investment options. With its focus on risk mitigation, BRI Ventures sought to provide a “safer” investment by examining P&Ls, balance sheets, and other financial indicators. By ensuring liquidity, the company aimed to reduce the possibility of losses and offer a return on investment. The moderate risk-moderate return strategy was designed to provide investors with an optimal balance of risk and reward, thereby attracting a diverse range of investors. As more fintech companies in Indonesia and Southeast Asia continued to mature, BRI Ventures had a plethora of investment opportunities to explore. The company could look into various fintech verticals, including payments, lending, insurance, and investment management, among others. The growing number of tech-savvy consumers in the region and the increasing adoption of digital services provided a favorable environment for fintech companies to thrive, making it an attractive investment option for us. As we now know, the following year, the Covid-19 pandemic thrust businesses into using digital platforms to continue their activities, and this surge in demand benefited many of our portfolio companies at the time.",
      "In the midst of uncertainty, we launched Dana Ventura Sembrani Nusantara or the Sembrani Nusantara Fund (another first of its kind) in June 2020, with an investment thesis “Value Over Valuation”; an antithesis of “Growth At All Cost.” And it is the first venture fund licensed and monitored by the OJK. Most people would have thought we were nuts to do this then, but we exceeded target expectations. We had learned so much from our past ventures that we decided to structure Sembrani differently than the usual GP/LP dynamics. It is more similar to a mutual fund where in this case LPs (investors) can put in their money and take it out at every period of subscription and redemption. In other words, LPs don’t have to wait forever to get their money back. However, the trick is that the fund size has to be much smaller than traditional VC funds, in order for the GP (in this case us at BRI Ventures) to maintain reserves in liquidity. It’s not perfect yet, but it’s a start. The name Sembrani reflects a mythological Javanese horse similar to a unicorn. Now, the name of the game is to simply survive and reach sustainable growth. The concept of the “unicorn” itself is a word adopted straight from Silicon Valley. It’s a concept that we think is beginning to lose its alignment with Indonesia’s digital ecosystem. We feel that we need our own symbol, one that can inspire local startups to rise from the ground and fly high. This is what the Sembrani represents.",
      "Simply put: It is everything that a unicorn is not. We will discuss more about the “Value Over Valuation” in the next chapter.",
      "The initial target for the Sembrani Nusantara Fund was only IDR 300 billion, but the fund was able to close at a slightly higher amount in early 2021. This success would not have been possible without the trust of our investors, who believed in our vision to nurture early stage technology-based companies with strong potential for growth and scalability. Sembrani’s debut whet the startup ecosystem’s appetite. With more capital and expertise available, the fund could help accelerate the growth of startups and contribute to the development of the Indonesian economy.",
      "However, the Sembrani fund is now competing with early stage funds, and many believe that CVCs should act as follow on investors rather than early stage investors. As corporate investors, CVCs have access to all the necessary resources for scaling up startup operations but often lack the expertise and experience required for early stage validation points. If CVCs like Sembrani focus on early stage investments, they may create conflicts of interest with early stage funds and hinder their growth. Early stage funds rely on investments in the seed stage of startups to create a pipeline of future investments. If CVCs compete for the same investments, it may result in adverse impacts on the overall ecosystem. Many have told me that CVCs should ideally focus on follow on investments, providing a vital source of capital for startups to grow and scale their operations. Corporate investors have significant resources that they can leverage to add value to portfolio companies, such as industry insights, expertise, and connections. By investing in the later stages of a startup’s growth, CVCs can help the startups reach their full potential and achieve their business objectives.",
      "As I mentioned earlier in the previous chapter, in 2021, the valuation for follow-on investments was extremely high, which was unprecedented. The valuations for Series B or Series C companies were reaching insane levels that were difficult to justify, even for experienced investment analysts. Many investment experts talked about a market correction, but no one knew for sure when. At that time, no one talked about life returning to normal, and the uncertainty created a sense of unease among investors. Despite the high valuations, many investors continued to pour money into startups, hoping to cash in on the boom. The pandemic-induced shift towards digital services created a favorable environment for startups to thrive, and many investors were eager to invest in companies that they believed had strong potential. Some investors worried that the market was overheated and that the high valuations were not backed by sound fundamentals. In the face of these challenges, BRI Ventures and the Sembrani Nusantara Fund had to make some tough decisions. We needed to strike a balance between maintaining our moderate risk-moderate return investment strategy and seizing opportunities in the rapidly evolving fintech landscape. With valuations skyrocketing, it was becoming increasingly difficult to find reasonably priced investment opportunities that aligned with our risk appetite and investment thesis. Moreover, we explored synergies with Bank Rakyat Indonesia to leverage its vast network and resources to support the growth of our portfolio companies. By collaborating closely with the bank, we could provide startups with strategic guidance, access to financial services, and introductions to potential partners and customers. This approach allowed us to add value beyond just providing capital and helped our portfolio companies navigate the challenges of the competitive fintech landscape. As the first venture fund incorporated in Indonesia, the Sembrani Nusantara Fund has set a strong precedent for other CVC funds to follow. In fact, Merah Putih Fund (MPF), the sovereign venture fund of a state enterprise, was modeled after the Sembrani Nusantara Fund, with its unique localization of the traditional VC fund in general."

    "THE REALISTIC RETURN THRESHOLD (RTT) MODEL": [
      "OKAY, first of all, you will find nothing when you Google “Realistic Return Threshold.” We just came up with the term when we first wrote about it just for fun in 2014, after realizing our losses at Systec Ventures. We or I, specifically, felt that we just weren’t a lucky bunch. VC investing is like Russian roulette — well, maybe the odds are bigger in startups when you consider the business model, management team, product-market fit, and financial projections to make an informed decision (contrary to popular belief, it’s all about managing the risk rather than all out on opportunities). Skilled investors may be able to identify patterns and trends that increase the likelihood of success, but there is still a significant element of unpredictability and risk involved, such as factors outside of the investor’s control, such as market conditions, competition, consumer behavior... and the 2020 global pandemic lockdown.",
      "In roulette, while the outcome of each spin is technically random, there are certain factors that can influence the outcome, such as the speed of the ball, the amount of spin applied to the wheel, and the condition of the wheel and ball. Skilled players may be able to exploit these factors to some extent, but the overall odds are still heavily weighted in favor of the house.",
      "While we could calculate a simple probability formula for winning with a given roulette bet:",
      "Odds for Winning = Probability of Winning / (1 – Probability of Winning). For early stage investing this simple probability formula gets more complex: Odds for Winning = (Probability of Business Model Viability * Probability of Market Potential * Probability of Team Quality * Probability of Financial Stability) / (1 - (Probability of Business Model Viability * Probability of Market Potential * Probability of Team Quality * Probability of Financial Stability))",
      "Please note that this is not a scientifically proven formula and should not be relied upon for investment decisions. Therefore, there are elements of both randomness and non-randomness in both roulette and early stage investing. You’re placing bets on startups, hoping to hit the jackpot and strike it big. But as with roulette, the odds are against you. While the payouts can be huge, there’s always the risk of losing everything. This is where the concept of the “realistic return threshold” comes in.",
      "The realistic return threshold is a way for investors to set a limit on how much they’re willing to risk and how much they expect to gain. It’s a way to balance the excitement of potential gains with the reality of potential losses. Think of it as the line in the sand that separates smart investing from reckless gambling.",
      "But how do you set a realistic return threshold? It’s subjective, and depends on factors like your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. However, one possible formula is: Realistic Return Threshold = (Initial Investment * Return Multiple) / Investment Horizon. This formula takes into account your initial investment, the desired return multiple (e.g., 5x, 10x, 20x), and the expected time horizon for the investment (e.g., 3 years, 5 years, 10 years). For example, if you invest $100,000 in a startup with a desired return multiple of 5x and an expected investment horizon of 4 years, your realistic return threshold would be $125,000. This means that you would aim to cash out when the startup reaches a money multiple of $125,000 or more, in order to achieve your desired return multiple. Of course, this is just one formula and shouldn’t be relied upon as the sole factor in making investment decisions. Other factors like the startup’s financial performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment should also be considered. The realistic return threshold is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of self-control and humility in investing. It’s like the Zen-self-control-mode, but for investors. The principle is simple: know when to “quit” and take profits and minimize risk.",
      "Remember that this type of asset is primarily about “momentum selling,” and you will only have liquidity when there is an oversubscribed round of the next investment, a buyout, or an IPO.",
      "Don’t let your ego — and the excessive overconfidence — get in the way of making smart decisions.",
      "Investors who are overconfident and ignore the realistic return threshold run the risk of losing everything. They may be tempted to keep investing with the hope of achieving even greater gains, but the reality is that there’s always the possibility of losing everything. Knowing when to cash out and take what you’ve earned is a critical skill for investors. The realistic return threshold is also linked to the concept of liquidity. Maintaining liquidity ensures that investors have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that arise, while also protecting against unexpected losses. Liquidity can provide the resources needed to participate in other promising ventures.",
      "It is a way to balance risk and reward in VC investing. It’s a philosophical approach that emphasizes the importance of self-control, humility, and moderation in decision-making. By knowing when to take profits and minimize risk, investors can achieve long-term success while maintaining a sense of perspective and balance. So, go ahead and place your bets, but don’t forget to set your realistic return threshold. As the investment amount in this sector continues to grow during the 2019-2021 period, there were numerous VCs who booked an average 3x money multiple on investments made in 2015, despite the short holding period of just 3-4 years. As the trend continued upward, the excitement grew, and there seemed to be no compelling reason to sell early. Many LPs believed it would be unwise to sell cheap at a mere 3x return. With the momentum of 2021 reaching an all-time high and average portfolio returns showing a 5x money multiple, there was little urgency to sell. One VC partner confided that they anticipated a 6-7x money multiple would be the optimal exit point, as the fund life approached its end at nearly 8 years (VC funds typically last 8-10 years, with the possibility of a one year extension).",
      "However, 2022 arrived and proved to be a rude awakening. As the liquidity period approached, many VCs found themselves unable to offload their portfolio companies, leading to panic selling. The sell-off process in VC is far from straightforward—it’s not as simple as selling shares in the capital markets. VCs must find buyers willing to acquire their shares in secondary transactions. To do this, they need to convince potential buyers that the company is still on an upward trajectory, making their shares valuable. Yet, 2022 brought a downward shift, not an upward one.",
      "This is where the concept of Realistic Return Threshold comes into play. While it serves primarily as a guideline, it has long been in writing as a reminder to be cautious of too-good-to-be-true storytelling and to reiterate that we might not be as fortunate as we believe. It’s crucial to remember the mantra “we’re not that lucky” and keep a grounded perspective on the reality of VC investments and the returns they can generate. THE FRONTIERS OF VENTURE"
    ],
    "INVESTMENT REVISITED": [
      "MANY in the industry may believe that CVCs aren’t the best place to develop one’s career in investment. However, these skeptics often overlook the fact that many CVCs start as new setups with only a small, skeleton crew on board. I was fortunate to bring my team from Systec Ventures to continue their work at this newly minted shop under the banner of Telkom Indonesia. At a fundamental level, any CVC would follow its parent company’s governance and compliance guidelines, which would depend on the sector the parent company operates in. For example, the governance and compliance requirements for a CVC with a telco parent company would be significantly more relaxed than those for a CVC with a banking parent company. In addition to the parent company’s guidelines, the CVC entity would also be subject to any relevant regulations, such as those enforced by OJK.",
      "Interestingly enough, I might be biased in saying that this unique characteristic of state-owned CVCs in Indonesia seems to be particularly well-suited to the startup landscape in the country, and perhaps even in the wider region that has only recently begun to develop its own VC ecosystem. While the governance and compliance requirements for CVCs may not fully embody the traditional VC model, they do provide a necessary balance within the industry. This is especially true as the regulatory landscape for startups in Indonesia is still a work in progress, making it essential for CVCs to establish a solid foundation of governance and compliance practices. In a region where the startup ecosystem is still emerging, having state-owned CVCs with strong governance and compliance frameworks can help promote stability and trust among market participants. This can create a more attractive environment for entrepreneurs and investors alike, fostering the growth and development of the local startup ecosystem. During the heyday of startup investments, when any VC could write a check in under 15 minutes, CVCs might not have been seen as the “ideal” go-to investor, given the layers of process and governance involved (usually taking 4-5 months to complete due diligence). However, during economic downturns, the very governance and compliance practices that slow down CVCs become increasingly valued by LPs, who start to seek more stringent controls from their GPs, similar to those found in CVCs. In times of turbulence, CVCs with robust governance and compliance practices have a unique opportunity to turn these perceived drawbacks into strengths. By adhering to rigorous standards, CVCs can provide increased confidence and assurance to their LPs and the startups they invest in, creating a competitive edge in a market where trust is paramount.",
      "A notable example of a CVC leveraging its governance and compliance practices during a downturn is Intel Capital, the venture arm of the global technology giant Intel Corporation. Amid the 2008 financial crisis, Intel Capital continued to make investments while many traditional VCs pulled back. The CVC’s strong governance and compliance framework allowed it to navigate the challenging environment and identify investment opportunities with a focus on long-term value creation.",
      "Another case study highlighting the importance of governance and compliance in CVCs is GV (formerly Google Ventures), the CVC arm of Alphabet Inc. GV has been known for its data-driven investment approach and strict adherence to governance and compliance standards, which has helped it maintain a solid reputation and build a diverse portfolio of successful startups. This disciplined approach to investing has allowed GV to weather market fluctuations and maintain the confidence of its parent company, LPs, and portfolio companies.",
      "Within the context of state-owned enterprises, compliance and governance can serve as a protective moat against both internal and external political pressures. On one hand, the primary responsibility of a state-owned CVC is to manage the fund effectively and generate profits. On the other hand, as an entity tied to the government, it must also uphold the state’s mandate to benefit the nation’s broader ecosystem through strategic investments and initiatives. This dual role can create unique challenges for state owned CVCs, as they must navigate the delicate balance between fulfilling their fiduciary duties and supporting the government’s broader objectives. To successfully manage this balance, state-owned CVCs can leverage the strengths of both their corporate and venture capital backgrounds. By adhering to strict compliance and governance standards, state-owned CVCs can minimize the impact of political pressures on their decision-making processes. This approach enables them to focus on making sound investments that align with their core mandate while also contributing to the overall health and growth of the national ecosystem. While compliance and governance might be likened to the braking system components of an automobile, it is important to remember that the overall performance of a CVC cannot be solely determined by these two factors. This is where the GP’s investment thesis comes into play, guiding the CVC’s strategy and decision-making.",
      "I have observed several CVCs that focus solely on compliance and governance treating the entity as a mere tool for the parent company to conduct experiments, often without adhering to the fundamental VC principles of generating profit. For example, some CVCs may not prioritize capital gains at all, choosing instead to focus on creating synergies that benefit their parent company. To me, this approach reflects a flawed mindset, as it does not account for the shifting political dynamics and strategic priorities that are inherent in any corporate environment.",
      "As I mentioned in earlier paragraphs, corporations often face political pressures and must adapt to different styles of management and board direction over time. In the context of a CVC, what may be beneficial for the parent company today may not be advantageous for the parent company of tomorrow, as changes in strategy, personnel, and internal politics can happen rapidly.",
      "Perhaps the most effective approach for a CVC is to strike a balance between the structured world of corporate governance and the agile, entrepreneurial spirit of the startup ecosystem. This means that, in order to achieve optimal outcomes, a CVC must implement best practices and establish clear indicators of success.",
      "One widely recognized benchmark for success in the VC industry is a minimum Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 18 20%. This target implies that the total portfolio managed by a CVC must demonstrate consistent annual improvement in terms of both cost efficiency and paid-in capital. Ultimately, it is not enough for a CVC to show that its investments are successful on paper; the fund must also generate tangible returns in the form of cash.",
      "By marrying the best of both worlds — the discipline and oversight of corporate governance with the nimble, risk taking mindset of VC — a CVC can position itself for success, maximizing returns for both its parent company and its portfolio companies. This balanced approach allows CVCs to not only create synergies that benefit their parent companies, but also to generate real, sustainable value within the startup ecosystem.",
      "The future of venture investment in Indonesia and Southeast Asia might not lie within the conventional venture capital model. Even though this model has weathered several storms, from the dot-com bubble burst to the black swan event of 2020 and the crisis of 2022, it's prudent to consider the region's unique dynamics as distinct from mature markets like the US, China, and India. Instead, we could be better served by a venture build model or something akin to the Sembrani Nusantara Fund or Merah Putih Fund. These models operate like mutual funds, allowing limited partners (LPs) to subscribe and redeem at will (subject to specific terms and conditions, of course). In such a structure, LPs are not tied down by a lock-up period, nor are they required to commit all their capital upfront. And much like mutual funds, this model enables fund managers to provide yield dividends, shifting the portfolio's focus from a growth-at-all-cost mentality to a balanced approach emphasizing profitability. However, the path that venture investment in Indonesia takes needs to diverge from past models. The landscape here is entirely unique, shaped by distinctive talent, technologies, and market behaviors. We must reimagine the model to best leverage these regional particularities accordingly.",
      "Looking back on my journey at MDI Ventures and BRI Ventures, I can attest that these roles played a crucial part in forging the first corporate venture capital model in Indonesia. I’ve learned that the primary aim of every corporate venture capital firm is to manage risk while propelling transformation within the parent company. This involves exploring and embracing new technologies, nurturing inventive approaches to work, fostering collaborations, and ultimately, achieving profits as the supreme measure of success for the entire endeavor.",
      "Having spent nearly a decade in the field of corporate venture, I can assert with confidence that this is not your run of-the-mill storybook VC role. Instead, it’s an ever-evolving position that combines the responsibilities of a venture builder (constructing the CVC from the ground up), startup founder (as part of the founding team), talent developer (consider the scarcity of venture capital talent in Indonesia), corporate strategist (facilitating synergy and collaboration between parent LP and CVC portfolio), and story-teller (providing thought leadership) into a single dynamic role. As this role continues to evolve, it may generate value beyond investor returns, strengthening the industry and benefiting all stakeholders in the process."

  "CHAPTER SIX: (DON'T GO) CHASING UNICORNS": {
    "DON'T GO": [
      "REMEMBER this VC guy was saying, “Bro, if you come in with us, I’ll promise it’d be the next unicorn in the coming year and go IPO the following year. LFG!”",
      "Well, that was 2021. Now he’s saying, “WAGMI, bro!” The unicorn phenomenon in Indonesia took the investment world by storm during 2020-2021. The country minted around nine to a dozen unicorn companies in that year alone, which was nothing short of exceptional. Even non-unicorn companies were claiming to have a unicorn status based on their latest financing rounds, often from affiliated investor parties.",
      "The first sighting of the unicorn phenomenon in Indonesia was in 2017 with Traveloka. They secured a $350 million investment from Expedia, the largest online ticketing and accommodation platform based in the US, and achieved a $1 billion valuation at their Series C or D. This wasn’t an overnight success, though. From their first seed investment round in 2012 to the series that made them a unicorn in 2017, they went through several rounds of validation from more than a dozen VC and private equity investors, such as Sequoia Capital India, Global Founders Capital, Hillhouse Capital Group, and JD.com. The following year, Tokopedia and Gojek burst onto the scene with their respective $7 billion and $10 billion valuations. Both companies went through numerous fundraising rounds that eventually propelled them to unicorn status. These three companies quickly became renowned for their convenience and user-friendly services, effectively retaining customers.",
      "This rapid success led to a shift in the job market, with fresh graduates aspiring to work for these unicorn companies rather than traditional top employers. The investment community was captivated, and VCs began asking startups, “How long until you reach unicorn status?” This moment signified just how quickly and easily the unicorn status could be achieved.",
      "As we fast-forward to 2022-2023, the bubble has burst, and some unicorns have lost their billion-dollar statuses. The phrase “don’t go chasing unicorns” became a cautionary tale in Indonesia. The unicorn phenomenon had created somewhat a false sense of invincibility (and optimism) that led to the downfall of some companies, impacting the wider ecosystem.",
      "One company that embodies the turbulent journey of Southeast Asian tech unicorns is SEA Limited, as one of the first Southeast Asia’s unicorns to have listed in the public market. Founded in 2009, the Singapore-based e-commerce and gaming company went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2017 under the ticker symbol “SE.” Initially priced at $15 per share, the company’s stock experienced tremendous growth, reaching an all-time high of around $366 in October 2021. SEA Limited’s success was primarily driven by its online gaming arm, Garena, and its e-commerce platform, Shopee, which rapidly expanded across the region.",
      "However, as the markets corrected in 2022, SEA Limited’s stock price faced a significant decline, reflecting the overall downturn in tech stocks. Despite these setbacks, the company showcased its ability to adapt and find new opportunities in the region’s digital economy. SEA Limited continued to invest in and develop its core businesses, while also exploring potential synergies between its gaming, e-commerce, and fintech operations. This proactive approach allowed the company to remain resilient in the face of market headwinds. The current outlook of the VC industry in Southeast Asia is ‘dicey,’ to say the least. Softbank posted a massive loss in Q2 2022, and high-risk alternative assets are finally dipping after years of climbing valuations. Tiger Global lost around $17 billion due to sell-offs in tech stocks, erasing about two thirds of its gains in just four months.",
      "My take is this: the VC world is far from over, but the game has changed. The old model of VCs acting as the middleman between LPs and entrepreneurs will no longer be relevant in the next decade. Astronomical valuations no longer hold sway; liquidity is the only currency that matters. MDI Ventures had 11 healthy exits, and BRI Ventures, a three year-old firm, already has two exits because returning cold hard cash to investors is a priority, all things considered. In this chapter, we’ll explore the general laggards’ FOMO, discussing how they became aware of unicorns a bit too late. The focus will be on the consequences of chasing these companies at their later funding stages, highlighting the importance of realistic expectations and the changing landscape of the VC industry."
    ],
    "THE SHIFTING NARRATIVES": [
      "VCS like to challenge themselves by demanding more of themselves. Now the fund cycle is given shorter lapse — around 5-6 years of turnaround and greater liquidity as opposed to the traditional 8-10 years. I’m not saying it can’t be done, but this shift is only possible with fundamental overhaul. Fundraising, portfolio management, and operations must take different approaches. If you can find balanced short-term returns with longer-term goals and recalibrate risk profiles accordingly, then yes.",
      "The VC industry is adapting to the scarcity of deal making opportunities, with fewer companies performing well without excessive cash burn. In this section, we’ll explore the new narrative and personification that the VC industry is crafting, as it tries to navigate these tumultuous waters. In 2022, everyone in the region was raising a new fund to invest in seed and early stage companies. There’s nothing wrong with embracing a high-risk, high-reward ethos, but realistic exit plans should also be considered. It’s important not to turn a blind eye to the fact that very few are reaping the rewards between the two extreme points of IPOs or mega buyouts. A blockage in the pipeline is preventing investors from cashing out sensibly, and it’s time to fix the investment ecosystem pipes by directing liquidity into the Indonesian economy.",
      "Enter the secondary fund, a potential solution that puts money back into the hands of early backers, founders, and employees. These funds invest in companies nearing the end of their investment cycles, boasting financial stability and a proven ability to withstand economic downturns in the country.",
      "During times of market downturn, secondary funds often present an opportunity to acquire discounted private shares at 30-50% off their pre-crisis valuation. Investors can then hold onto these assets, waiting for the crisis to pass, and potentially reap rewards once the market stabilizes. However, the practice of secondary sales is somewhat taboo in the VC industry. Founders may try to sell their shares at every fundraising round, which can gradually diminish their incentive to build the company.",
      "One example of a successful secondary fund transaction is Spotify. In 2015, the company allowed its employees and early investors to sell shares through a secondary offering. This move helped Spotify maintain a strong valuation and enabled early backers to cash out without diluting ownership. The secondary sales proved to be a successful strategy, as Spotify continued to grow and eventually went public in 2018. On the other hand, a somewhat of a deterrent example can be found in the story of a tech startup that went through multiple funding rounds with secondary sales at each stage. The founders and early employees gradually sold off their stakes, which led to a diminished incentive to grow the company. As their focus on building the business waned, the startup’s progress stalled, and it ultimately failed to achieve the desired exit or IPO. This case serves as a warning about the potential pitfalls of secondary share sales when misused or overused.",
      "As the VC landscape shifts, it’s crucial for ‘long play’ investors to ask the right questions before committing capital. They should probe VC firms about projected liquidity timelines, pre-mapped exit scenarios, and strategies for avoiding unrealistic valuations. Both investors and startups should be mindful of the potential consequences of over inflating valuations.",
      "Liquidity is the key to success in the ever-changing Asian tech ecosystem. By ensuring that investors, founders, and managers see real returns, we can foster an environment where money begets money. This will help everyone involved to weather the storms of market corrections and global economic pressure, and reboot the startup investment landscape.",
      "The Indonesian economy has been relatively resilient, benefiting from rising commodity prices and government policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption and investment. However, investors need to be cautious and focus on value creation rather than valuations when navigating these new waters.",
      "As the world grapples with market corrections, geopolitical turmoil, and inflation, it’s essential to remember that these events are temporary and do not necessarily signal the end of a bull market. However many LPs would not buy into the idea of 10-12 year fund life like they used to. LPs would require a much shorter period of fund life in these uncertain times.",
      "To adapt to these changes, VCs have to shift their criteria for investment, prioritizing profitability but not at the expense of growth. Companies need to commit to a clear exit plan, have a strong conviction in the business model, product, and growth of the industry to attract big investors. This new approach to VC is fundamental-driven, not fear based. The old way of investing in companies backed by big global investors, as seen in the tech sell-off and startup bubble burst, is no longer effective.",
      "Simply put: 2011 - 2021: Invest in a company that is backed by big global investors. Then sell off to the last man standing. 2022 - onwards: Put in more time to look for and help build companies with founders to have a clear path of profitability.",
      "Having said that, we are now witnessing the convergence of the two approaches in the investment landscape, as VC is now behaving more like PE (private equity), and vice versa. Both have distinct investment strategies, with VC focusing on early stage, high-growth companies, and PE focusing on more mature, established businesses. Now that the startup ecosystem has evolved, the lines between the two have begun to blur.",
      "With less costs needed to start a business and with capital more readily available, the ecosystem became more mature and attractive to PE investors. And when COVID-19 pandemic started to cause volatility resulting in a market slowdown and fewer IPO exits, VCs turned to PE-style investments in later stage companies to make larger investments and hold onto their portfolio longer. The past journey of these companies has taught us that while they may rise quickly, they can also fall just as fast. Market cool-down illuminates which companies have strong fundamentals, able to survive during these difficult times, and which are struggling to stay afloat. This serves as a wake-up call for all companies, startups, and investors. Value over valuation is a key principle that will always be relevant. Switch off the snooze button, make that coffee."

      "• As high-profile markdowns are occurring, even the median level of valuations soften and leading investors to conclude that pricing has corrected. • The full extent of a recession’s impact is yet to be determined, but given the sheer volatility across public markets, it is likely that investment will remain muted in the back half of the year.",

This is the investment thesis of Sembrani Nusantara Fund when it launched in June of 2020 as a response to the overexcitement in the startup valuation game.",
      "Value Over Valuation emphasizes investing in companies that are undervalued by the market, whereas “Growth At All Cost” focuses on investing in companies that have high growth potential, even if overvalued.",
      "Simple mathematical formula for these two theses are: Value Over Valuation: P/E ratio < Industry Average AND ROE > Industry Average • Invest in companies with low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios, indicating they are undervalued by the market: P/E ratio < Industry Average • Invest in companies with high Return on Equity (ROE), indicating they have strong fundamentals: ROE > Industry Average Growth At All Cost: Revenue Growth Rate > 30% AND P/S ratio > Industry Average • Invest in companies with high revenue growth rates, indicating they have high growth potential: Revenue Growth Rate > 30% • Invest in companies with high price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, indicating the market is willing to pay a premium for their growth: P/S ratio > Industry Average While both investment theses have their strengths and weaknesses, the Value Over Valuation thesis is more conservative, and focuses on companies that have a proven track record of success and strong financials. On the other hand, the Growth At All Cost thesis is more aggressive, and investors following this thesis tend to focus on companies that are growing rapidly, even if their valuations seem high."

      "When a VC partner or associate is scouting potential deals or identifying key players in specific geographic areas or sectors, they must weigh information from various angles and perspectives, even for a single deal that is under consideration. Information asymmetry abounds in deal making, and VCs often sugarcoat the narrative of a specific deal, vertical, or sector to persuade you to invest in one of their portfolio companies’ next funding rounds. Take a stroll through Buck’s of Woodside, a coffee shop in Woodside, California, or visit Tanjong Pagar in Singapore or Ashta SCBD in Jakarta, and you’ll find VCs, entrepreneurs, and tech enthusiasts gathering daily to discuss ideas, share info on deals, and exchange industry trends. Some of the notable deals reportedly hashed out at Buck’s include the founding of Hotmail, PayPal, and Tesla Motors. In such settings, conversations and information shared may seem casual, but the stakes are high. Investors must carefully parse the data they receive and recognize the potential biases in the narratives presented. It’s important to cultivate a network of trusted sources who can provide valuable insights and corroborate or challenge the information received.",
      "The last decade was filled with hopes and promises, unicorns and disruptors, bubbles and bursts, lilies and tulips, and so on, because money was cheap after all. And with everyone having an agenda of their own, the new narrative on the digital economy became something that everyone should know in order to stay relevant. Even the most seasoned investors couldn’t resist the allure of FOMO deals at some point in their careers. It’s hard to resist temptation when you witness a world leader plugging the name of a particular startup on stage, and you can’t help but feel the urge to get your hands on a piece of that action. As the trend of the digital economy continued to evolve and reshape industries, the lines between hype and reality started to blur. Investors, founders, and even governments were swept up in the excitement, seeking to be a part of the next big thing. Tech unicorns and disruptive startups became the stars of the show, promising to revolutionize everything from transportation to healthcare, and finance to education. The thirst for wealth and fame were insatiable, and every day seemed to bring a new headline or viral sensation that captured a lot of attention. And as mentioned in the previous chapters, in the midst of this gold rush, investors scrambled to identify the best opportunities and secure their spot on the ground floor of the next unicorn. Amidst the frenzy, the fear of being left behind became a powerful driving force, pushing even the most cautious investors to take risks they might have otherwise avoided.",
      "The truth is, not only did startups benefit greatly from the favorable climate of the last decade, but VC firms did as well. They raised unprecedented amounts of capital, attracted top talent, and crafted ambitious visions to bring to life. The digital economy boom led to new jobs, wealth, fame, and opportunities that seemed almost too good to be true. And as with any boom, we know that it eventually crashes and burns.",
      "During the mid to late-2010s, growth-stage startups were often considered “safer” bets than early stage ventures, particularly when they had the backing of high-profile investors such as Softbank Vision Fund, KKR, Temasek, Sequoia, and GGV Capital. The rationale was simple: if these industry giants believed in startup “X,” for instance, why shouldn’t others follow suit? We know now, in hindsight, that they did not guarantee success or mitigate all risks associated with the investment.",
      "In contrast, early stage startups were deemed “riskier” investments, as they had not yet attracted the attention or backing of any high-profile investors. In this environment, the term “oversubscribed round” became quite common, and it had a powerful psychological effect on fund managers, prompting them to try to get in on the round at any cost — even resorting to secondary transactions if necessary.",
      "Remember I mentioned in the previous chapter that the concept of a secondary sale is considered taboo in the VC world? That is because the term could potentially hamper the momentum that the VC was building, and it could tarnish the next round of valuation with rumors of early investors or founders cashing out, which may indicate that something was going wrong. In this close-knit industry, any hint of trouble could result in a discounted valuation at the next round of fundraising, or worse, discourage other investors from participating in the next round altogether. And when you’re eager to invest and under pressure to deploy a certain amount of money within a specific timeframe, you might jump into the next round of fundraising and even be willing to acquire secondary shares from early backers. However, it can be a rude awakening when, in the following weeks, you discover that some of your invested funds were used to pay off the startup’s past debts. Stories like these occur more frequently than one might expect, but they often go unreported in the tech media due to their negative implications for the parties involved. In a high-stakes game like venture capital, maintaining a positive image and momentum is crucial to attract more investors and ensure the long-term success of a portfolio company. VCs carefully curate their narratives and promote their portfolio companies’ achievements to create a sense of excitement and optimism around their investments. In doing so, they can entice other investors to jump on board and participate in subsequent fundraising rounds. However, this constant need for positive momentum can lead to a skewed perception of a startup’s actual performance and potential. When secondary sales take place, it may be seen as a red flag — a signal that early investors or founders are losing faith in the company’s ability to deliver on its promises. This can create a domino effect, with other investors becoming wary and hesitant to invest, ultimately undermining the company’s growth and valuation.",
      "Entering a perceived “safer” growth-stage investment category could mean arriving late when everyone else has already exited the cap table."
    ],
    "TRICKY, LIQUIDITY (PART 1)": [
      "THE concept of liquidity, one of the trickiest topics in startup investment, has been one of the central themes in this book. Liquidity essentially represents the ease at which an asset can be converted into cash without causing any impact on its price like lower valuations or even abandoned by all the other investors as selling can be seen as “non-confident” in the future of the particular startup. It is the extent to which an asset can be rapidly bought or sold in the market without affecting its valuation. When it comes to stock markets, liquidity pertains to how quickly a stock can be bought or sold without causing any price changes. Stocks with high liquidity are typically those with active trading and plenty of buyers and sellers, allowing for rapid buying or selling of shares without impacting their market value.",
      "Similarly, in bond markets, liquidity is about how swiftly a bond can be bought or sold without any impact on its price. Bonds with high liquidity are generally actively traded, having a large pool of buyers and sellers which facilitates the quick buying or selling of bonds without impacting their market price.",
      "In terms of private equity and venture capital, liquidity is the capability of investors to divest their stakes in a portfolio company. Such investments are typically illiquid, implying that investors must retain their investments for a significant duration before they can sell them. Some funds may provide limited liquidity options to investors like periodic buybacks or secondary market sales.",
      "The illiquidity of private equity and venture capital investments primarily stems from lock-up periods which mandate investors to commit their capital for a substantial period before they can retrieve it. This ensures fund managers have sufficient time to implement their investment strategy and yield returns. However, this also limits the investor’s ability to access their capital when required. Further adding to the illiquidity is the limited market for these assets. Unlike publicly traded stocks and bonds, these investments are often sold to a select group of sophisticated investors, making it tough for investors to find buyers for their shares, especially if they are small investors with restricted resources.",
      "A case in point of the liquidity challenges faced in private equity and venture capital investments is WeWork. Despite raising billions from investors, WeWork encountered significant difficulties when it tried to go public through an IPO in 2019, which was ultimately canceled due to investor skepticism about the company’s business model and governance. This left WeWork’s investors with limited exit options as the shares were not publicly traded. In my own experience, I have been able to sell some shares without a lock-up period through pre-IPO rounds where everyone’s confidence is at an all-time high. Well, you may be called a “chicken” because no one else is selling except you, but in the end, being called a “chicken” — which I’ve been called many times — is better than being called a “fool” . You’ll live to invest another day, and it’s important to prioritize your own financial goals and risk tolerance over the opinions of others.",
      "Another tricky part is that there is often no established market price for private equity and venture capital assets. Unlike openly traded stocks and bonds that have daily market prices easily accessible, the market price of a venture capital investment often remains indeterminate until the asset is sold. Similar to the initial term sheet, nothing is certain until funds are transferred. Moreover, startups under private equity and venture capital often lack transparency, providing minimal public financial information to investors unless legally obligated. This can pose challenges for subsequent investors in assessing the risks and potential rewards of their investments, potentially making it more difficult to find buyers for the investment.",
      "It’s not unusual for all involved parties to reach an agreement on buying secondaries during the forthcoming fundraising round, only to be notified a week later that the upcoming round will not, after all, incorporate secondaries due to a change in investors’ preferences. This situation is all too familiar to many investors who have witnessed deals collapse at the last moment due to a range of factors, including a change in the addressable market, unforeseen legal hurdles, or changes in investor sentiment. For those who have encountered multiple unsuccessful deals, the process can be disheartening. Even the most seasoned investors can be surprised by the volatile nature of the market. Across the 11 trade sales exits I’ve been involved in between 2018 and 2023, this has happened all too frequently. At every exit liquidity moment, venture capitalists are essentially crossing their fingers and praying for a successful outcome, knowing that the unpredictable nature of the market can throw unexpected obstacles in their path. All I can tell you is that this is not for the faint hearted!"

    "AN INTERLUDE: WHEN EVERYONE’S HAVING A PARTY AND YOU DIDN’T GET THE INVITE": [
      "THIS part of the chapter continues the narrative, specifically addressing the laggards in the startup investment scene. So, who didn’t get invited to the party round? Usually, it’s the corporate investors. One might argue that private equity firms would opt for the later stages, as the party round is often too small in size for their typical investment. But hey, who wouldn’t want a good deal when the opportunity presents itself? The party round, where a multitude of investors pour funds into a promising startup, often generates a substantial amount of buzz, creating momentum that drives further investments and potentially leads to the next big success story.",
      "Corporate investors, often constrained by their more rigid investment criteria and decision-making processes, may find themselves on the sidelines as they watch the party unfold. They might be eager to participate, but bureaucracy and slower reaction times can hinder their ability to act swiftly. Moreover, these latecomers may struggle to establish relationships with the most innovative and promising startups. Founders often prefer to partner with investors who share their vision and have schemes tailored specifically for the late entrants. For example, when VC “X” invests in fintech startup “Y,” they might discourage CVC “Z” from coming in at the early stage, citing reasons such as, “the deal is too early and too risky for CVC to take on; why don’t you guys wait for more validation? We wouldn’t dare to present a half-baked opportunity to you.” However, behind the scenes, VC “X” and fintech startup “Y” know that CVC “Z” would be interested in the follow-on round. What VC “X” and fintech startup “Y” need to do is to establish a valuation multiple that makes sense for CVC “Z” to justify. By carefully crafting a narrative that positions the startup as a more mature and lower-risk investment, VC “X” and fintech startup “Y” can ensure that they are ready to bring CVC “Z” onboard when the time is right, and they get to book a gain on paper next year. Again, the story above also happens all too often, but no one says anything about it as, in an ideal situation, this approach demonstrates the complex dynamics that often exist between investors and startups in the competitive world of VC, and how careful planning and negotiation can lead to mutually beneficial partnerships. However, during less favorable circumstances, such as the collapse of a company, this practice leaves late entrants with a negative experience within the ecosystem, potentially resulting in maneuvers that leave a lasting impact on the industry.",
      "One critical aspect to always bear in mind is the underlying motivation of venture capitalists: Why would any VC willingly share their deals with other investors (outside their exclusive circle) when they could monopolize the profits for themselves? This fundamental question underscores the competitive nature of the industry and the various tactics employed to maintain an edge.",
      "By building on this understanding, it is crucial for both new and experienced investors to approach the venture capital landscape with a healthy dose of skepticism and due diligence. While the industry thrives on the sharing of ideas and opportunities, it is also rife with hidden agendas and strategic maneuvering.",
      "To mitigate potential risks and make informed decisions, investors must recognize that not all opportunities are presented with their best interests in mind.",
      "Always keep this in mind: sometimes beware of the invite."

  "CHAPTER SEVEN: IN SEARCH OF FOOL'S GOLD": {
    "IN SEARCH": [
      "GROWING up in the 90s, and like all high schoolers at that time, we were in awe of Indonesia’s economic development— pre the crisis of 1998, of course! During the New Order era of the government, we were all drawn into the idea of the “Indonesian Dream,” as the country looked to become one of the industrial nations in Asia. Most nations in the world during the mid-90s praised Indonesia as it was poised to join the ranks of the Asian Economic Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) as one of the emerging Tiger Cub Economies, alongside Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The tigers’ development served as an inspiration for other emerging economies in the region, as they sought to emulate their success. However, the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997-1998 severely impacted some of these countries, leading them to become developed nations with more stable growth. The Asian Economic Crisis began with the collapse of the Thai baht in 1997, quickly spreading throughout the region as countries faced financial turmoil. Currency devaluations, stock market crashes, and soaring unemployment rates plagued the affected countries. The crisis exposed structural weaknesses in the affected economies, including excessive borrowing, inadequate regulation, and crony capitalism. To overcome the crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided financial assistance, conditional on the implementation of economic reforms. The crisis was a turning point for the Asian Tigers, prompting them to reassess their economic strategies and ultimately paving the way for more sustainable and balanced growth.",
      "At that time, for every teenager in Indonesia, it was the ultimate dream to live the ‘Indonesian Dream,’ a life filled with rainbows and everything in between.",
      "The Asian Economic Crisis dealt a heavy blow to Indonesia, with the rupiah losing over 80% of its value against the US dollar. Inflation soared, capital fled, and foreign debt increased, while the banking sector crumbled under non-performing loans and inadequate capitalization. Political instability and corruption compounded the crisis, making it difficult for Indonesia to attract foreign investment and implement necessary reforms. The IMF stepped in with a rescue package, but its stringent conditions led to short-term economic pain and social unrest.",
      "Indonesia’s struggle to recover hindered its ability to establish a strong industrial base in the 1990s. In contrast, China’s market-oriented economic reforms fueled rapid industrialization and growth, with the nation emerging as a global economic powerhouse by the 21st century. In the early 2000s, Indonesia’s future was uncertain. The tech sector was in its infancy, and it was unclear whether the country could transition into a service and tourism-driven economy. Despite challenges, Indonesia made progress in diversifying its economy, with the palm oil and coal industries playing significant roles in the recovery.",
      "However, the environmental and social consequences of these industries’ rapid expansion raised concerns. The global focus on climate change and renewable energy eventually led to a decline in demand for coal and palm oil. The mid-2010s saw the rise of the digital economy in Indonesia, with the tech sector playing an increasingly important role. The idea that we as Indonesians could take center stage in Southeast Asia’s digital economy was both exhilarating and empowering, as it showcased our potential to innovate, create, and lead in a rapidly evolving global landscape.",
      "Did you know, for example, that it was actually Gojek and Grab that inspired Uber to release Uber Eat? In Forbes’ guest column article dated in November of 2019 written by Michelle Evans, Global Lead of Retail and Digital Consumer Insights at Euromonitor International titled “Uber’s New Strategy Mimics Asian Super Apps Grab And Gojek”. The column is a huge validation for these two Southeast Asian tech giants and the fact that Uber, a global mobility giant, is adopting strategies pioneered by Grab and Gojek in Southeast Asia validates the success of these companies’ “super app” business models. Grab and Gojek started as mobility platforms but quickly expanded their offerings to include delivery, lifestyle, and financial services, capitalizing on their large user bases to boost revenue. Uber’s decision to emulate some of Grab and Gojek’s strategies, such as launching Uber Money and acquiring Cornershop, underlines the strong potential of the super app model to generate new revenue streams, boost profitability, and enhance customer satisfaction. This move also signifies that the super app approach, initially developed and tested in Southeast Asia, is universally applicable and could lead to success in other markets, including the US.",
      "Everything appeared to be progressing smoothly for Indonesia to take center stage in the digital economy. It is important to note that Indonesia is Grab’s largest market, and several other Singapore-based tech unicorns also have a significant presence in the country. This demonstrates the immense potential and strategic importance of the Indonesian market for these rapidly growing technology companies. I often wonder how the situation would have unfolded if the Covid-19 pandemic had never occurred or if 2021 had played out differently, with a market correction instead of overvaluation. Such alternative scenarios might have significantly impacted Indonesia’s position in the digital economy and the growth trajectory of tech companies in the region."

    "MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEM": [
      "VCS like to challenge themselves by demanding more of themselves. Now the fund cycle is given shorter lapse; 5-6 years of turnaround and greater liquidity as opposed to the traditional 8-10 years. I’m not saying it can’t be done, but this shift is only possible with fundamental overhaul. Fundraising, portfolio management, and operations must take different approaches. If you can find balanced short-term returns with longer-term goals and recalibrate risk profiles accordingly, then yes, it can be done",
      "In the developed markets, venture capital focused primarily on providing funds to startups in the technology and biotech sectors, hands-on providing not only financial capital, but also strategic and operational guidance. Often former entrepreneurs who utilized empirical experiences get their hands dirty by becoming an operator themselves. Venture capitalists, in the midst of the bull-run, got a tad complacent. With countless opportunities knocking at their door, many adopted a more hands-off approach, casting a wider net and providing funding to a broader range of startups across various sectors. They became more focused on financial returns, often neglecting to offer the strategic and operational guidance that startups so desperately need. (Note: Newsflash, mentoring isn’t the same as getting your hands dirty, folks!)",
      "In the early days, VCs in the region were entrusted with smaller funds, primarily to scout for opportunities in early stage companies. However, as the industry expanded, many found themselves wielding larger purses to deploy. Yet, the reality is that managing a $100 million fund is a far cry from overseeing a mere $5-10 million, and navigating a whopping $500 million is an entirely different ball game than handling $100 million. Take, for example, my disillusionment with my former “CVC” following my departure in 2019. After the success of the first fund (AUM $100 million), the company ambitiously raised another one called “CVC500” — as the name suggests, with an AUM of $500 million — in 2021.",
      "The underlying assumption was that the company could replicate the success of the first fund at least fivefold, given the exponential increase in size.",
      "This assumption may have been overly optimistic as managing such a significant leap in assets requires a different shift in strategy and mindset. A larger fund isn’t simply a matter of writing a larger check into the same deals, and multiplying the previous success; it demands an entirely new approach, one that is sensitive to the unique challenges and complexities of operating at a much grander scale. In the world of VC, timing is everything. You can have a flawless business plan and an exceptional C-suite in place, but progress will remain at a standstill without a perfect timing.",
      "As the co-founder of two venture capital funds, Systec Ventures and MDI Ventures, I’ve experienced first-hand the rollercoaster of investing in the early years of the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem. The stories of these two funds serve as a testament to the importance of timing, adaptability, and the evolution of investment strategies in VC. When I launched my first fund, Systec Ventures, in 2010, the Southeast Asian ecosystem was still in its infancy — sure, we missed a lot of good deals back then. The fund’s assets under management (AUM) stood at a modest $5 million, and opportunities for investments were limited. The region was still finding its footing in the world of technology and innovation, making it trickier to identify promising startups to invest in without the support of a mature ecosystem. Fast forward to 2015, when MDI Ventures was just established, a fund with a significantly larger AUM of $100 million. The region’s landscape had shifted dramatically since the days of Systec Ventures. The global startup scene was recovering from the stock market sell-off of 2015-2016, which had a significant impact on the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem. Many startups in the region faced difficulties in raising funds and scaling their businesses, particularly those in the growth stages.",
      "When we were invited by Telkom Indonesia to co-write the investment thesis for its CVC plan, we were competing with a few other VCs in the region to manage the planned AUM of $100 million. Back then, in 2015, that size of AUM was considered to be the largest sum for a venture-type fund in Indonesia, and we were placed among medium-sized funds like Singtel Innov8 Ventures (AUM of $250 million in 2014), 500 Startups (AUM of $80 million in 2017), among a few others.",
      "So we toyed around with a theory that we came up with, and we called this the Fund Scaling Complexity Theory or FSCT. It’s pretty simple, with known variables that are easy to follow: • F1: Size of the initial fund • F2: Size of the new, larger fund • S1: Success of the initial fund (measured by a success factor, e.g., ROI or exits) • S2: Success of the new fund Now, one might initially assume that simply increasing the fund size would result in a proportional increase in success. In other words: F2 = F1 * k S2 = S1 * k (Where k is the scaling factor) But we knew that couldn’t be possible, considering our old thesis at Systec Ventures with the fund 20 times the magnitude in the new shop we were setting up at that time as we realized that our mindset can’t be straightforward arithmetic in this context. Instead, the increased complexity of managing a larger fund should be taken into account. Thus, we introduce the complexity factor C, which increases as the fund size grows.",
      "• C: Complexity factor (a coefficient representing the increased complexity of managing a larger fund) We can rewrite the formula for S2 as: S2 = S1 * (k / C) As the fund size grows (k increases), the complexity factor C also increases, reducing the overall impact of the scaling factor on the success of the new fund. This illustrates that scaling up a fund’s size isn’t as simple as arithmetic, and the increased complexity of managing a larger fund must be considered when predicting success.",
      "The contrasting experiences of these two funds demonstrate the importance of adaptability and the willingness to evolve in the ever-changing world of venture capital. The lessons learned from Systec Ventures enabled us to pivot and find success with MDI Ventures in a more mature and competitive ecosystem.",
      "Learning from the experiences of both venture firms adopted a different investment thesis. Instead of focusing solely on the nascent Southeast Asian market, we set our sights on the global stage, targeting more developed exit markets such as Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. This change in strategy allowed us to capitalize on the growing momentum in the region and seize opportunities that would have been unthinkable just a few years earlier. With this mindset, we approached managing BRI Ventures, which boasted an even larger AUM of $200 million. Building on the lessons learned from our experiences with Systec Ventures and MDI Ventures, we knew that the same investment strategies wouldn’t be directly applicable to this new fund. Instead, we needed to factor in the increased complexity and broader scope that a larger AUM demanded. So when scaling up — or downsizing your fund (it’s already happening guys), always remember: it’s not just about the numbers, mind the C!"

    "CRAFTING THE NEXT MOMENTUM": [
      "IN fairy tales, rainbows are often associated with magical or mystical places, such as the end of a rainbow where a pot of gold is said to be hidden. And for what it’s worth, the period of boom not only put Indonesia on the map of global tech investment, but has created a more favorable and friendlier environment for the industry to continue to grow in the near future... perhaps leading to magical treasures. Indonesia has managed to create a local market moat with the advantages of being an asset-holding location and IPO destination. In the last five years, 257 companies have gone public in the country, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.67%. In 2021 alone, these companies raised a total of IDR 62.6 trillion (approximately $4.3 billion) through initial public offerings, which is an 11x YoY increase, with two of the top three biggest IPOs in Indonesia in 2021 being Bukalapak, which raised IDR 21.9 trillion, and GoTo which raised IDR 15.8 trillion. Though the outcome wasn’t as we all expected it to be, these developments should be a start of something down the line. Indonesia’s large domestic growing population propels significant growth in IPOs. The process of going public is relatively easy and efficient, as exemplified by Bukalapak, one of the country’s most successful e-commerce platforms, which completed its IPO process in less than 6 months. The OJK and the Indonesia IDX have streamlined the regulations and requirements to save time and money to perform share swap. Share swap is an exchange of shares between two companies, which can result in double taxation when going public. Local and international investment banks, legal firms and accounting firms providing IPO services in Indonesia also assist companies to structure and price their offerings.",
      "More than 90% of issuers choose to list on their domestic stock exchanges, according to a report by EY. This suggests companies perform better in their home market because they understand which way the wind blows. Investors who are more familiar with the company’s operations and the local market conditions can tap into the company’s potential and therefore appraise favorable valuation.",
      "Indonesia’s leading e-commerce giant, Blibli, made a splash with its initial public offering (IPO) at the end of 2022. In a strategic move prior to the IPO, the company announced its acquisition of Ranch Market Group, a chain of offline supermarkets, for a reported $125 million. This acquisition aimed to bolster Blibli’s ecosystem and facilitate future business expansion. The company’s decision to merge with a profitable offline supermarket chain, while not necessarily a groundbreaking strategy, demonstrated an effort to provide a more stable offering for investors. The public had previously been shaken by the dramatic drop in Bukalapak’s stock price, which opened at IDR 1,800 and plummeted to IDR 300 in the weeks that followed. By diversifying its business model and integrating a brick-and-mortar retail component, Blibli hoped to assuage investor concerns and avoid a similar fate to the previous two unicorns IPO in the country. Also, there wasn’t that much chatter among tech IPO enthusiasts and the capital markets leading to the company’s IPO. And until today, the price of IDX: BELI.JK remains relatively stable with minimal fluctuation at 4-5%. Well, for the time being, at least we don’t have to brace for another unicorn ripple effect, although it is far from over. In late 2021, Indonesia announced a new regulation that allows tech companies to issue multiple voting shares when conducting an initial public offering on the country’s stock exchange, which would pave the way for local tech giant GoTo to come to the market. Through the OJK Regulation No.22/POJK./04/2021, they would allow tech companies to have multiple voting rights when they conduct an initial public offering on the country’s stock exchange. The dual class shares framework, which is a common practice among startups in the US, can incentivize Indonesia’s fast-growing tech companies to list on the IDX and increase its attractiveness to both domestic and international investors. The regulation stipulates that eligible shareholders will be allowed multiple voting rights over ten years, which can be extended for another decade if approved in a general shareholders meeting. This regulation can benefit the next unicorn listing such as Traveloka, Dana, Xendit, among others to be listed in the home market with a lot of ease. The change was an effort to encourage financial market deepening, especially the capital market sector by accommodating tech companies that would be relevant to future generations, that currently make up 80% of the total retail investors. On a different front, the aftermath of the 2022 crisis in the startup ecosystem presented another opportunity for early stage investors: investing in angel and seed stage startups.",
      "Investing in early stage startups offers a way to build a stronger position in the market. In light of the current inflation, war in Ukraine, a poor IPO market, price pullbacks of companies, and the possibility of a recession, it is important to reassess the hyper-frothy startup valuation landscape. Investing in very early stage startups can provide: • Longer term bets with long runways, allowing investors to wait out the lull in IPO interest • Access to low valuations with high potential returns • Grants to later-stage rounds and favorable terms On the other hand, as IPOs and SPACs freeze and the traditional 8 to 10-year fund structures approach the end of their first cycle fund life in this region (vintage 2012-2014), secondary deals are starting to heat up. This presents an opportunity to invest in later-stage companies that are close to liquidity events, providing liquidity to ourselves. These deals offer: • A way to take advantage of the liquidity crunch for vintage funds as traditional 8- to 10-year fund structures are no longer aligned with the time it takes for a company to exit through a public offering. • The ability to invest in companies at discounted prices due to the macro circumstances causing strain on valuations, which can result in discounts of up to 40% of their 2021 prices. Another significant event with the potential to reinvigorate the ecosystem, contingent upon global macroeconomic factors, is the trend of tech buyouts and consolidation. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed several notable examples: Grab acquired Kudo in 2017, Gojek scooped up Loket and Moka in 2017 and 2020, Bridestory was snapped up by Tokopedia in 2019, and of course, the colossal merger of GoTo in 2021.",
      "Interestingly, all of these events took place within the private markets. Giants like Grab, Gojek, and Tokopedia pursued mergers and acquisitions primarily to bolster their size and secure their next round of fundraising. In the current climate, however, we’re seeing some unicorn companies struggling to weather the storm and survive the proverbial “startup winter.” Consequently, the future of consolidation in this space may look quite different from what unfolded during the halcyon days of startups.",
      "As the industry evolves and companies grapple with new challenges, we can anticipate seeing mergers and acquisitions driven more by necessity than ambition. Faced with shrinking resources and heightened competition, startups may need to band together to pool their assets, streamline their operations, and fend off aggressive market forces.",
      "In this new era of consolidation, the race isn’t just to grow for the sake of growth. Instead, the focus is on strategic collaboration, mutual support, and leveraging complementary strengths to secure a foothold in the ever changing landscape. This shift, though perhaps a departure from the heady exuberance of the past, may well prove to be a more sustainable and resilient approach for the future of the tech ecosystem. The stakes are higher than ever, and the players must adapt or face the harsh realities of a cold, unforgiving winter. ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM",
      "IN today’s VC investment landscape, very few VCs are interested in participating in later-stage rounds. It’s reminiscent of the age-old tale of two men who embark on a journey to find the end of the rainbow and the fabled pot of gold that awaits them there. Along the way, they encounter a mischievous leprechaun who tricks them into believing they’ve discovered the treasure. In reality, they end up leaving empty-handed, as the gold has been concealed or relocated.",
      "Lately, there’s been a buzz within the VC community about venturing into emerging markets such as Africa or Vietnam. Over dinner, one VC partner remarked, “Maybe we can replicate the success of companies like Grab, Gojek, or Funding Societies in these budding digital ecosystems.” Like nomads in search of greener pastures, VC has a tendency to gravitate towards new opportunities. A prime example of this is Sequoia Capital, a renowned VC firm that has extended its global reach by launching Sequoia India in 2006. This strategic move allowed the firm to tap into the rapidly growing Indian startup ecosystem, which has since birthed numerous successful unicorns, such as Flipkart, Zomato, and Byju’s. After all, there are still countless people worldwide who have yet to experience the convenience of hailing a taxi online or having shampoo delivered to their doorstep in under 30 minutes.",
      "As mega funds strategize their next moves within the digital space, numerous mid-sized VCs are seeking easier plays and attempting to capitalize on the remnants of the Web 2.0 growth era. These venture capitalists are eager to find the next untapped market, hoping to secure promising investments before the competition becomes too fierce. One example of this trend is the growing interest in frontier markets, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa, which are witnessing a surge in mobile and internet penetration rates. Startups in these regions are developing innovative solutions to local problems, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for mid-sized VCs. For instance, Flutterwave, a Nigerian fintech company, has successfully raised funds from various investors, including Greycroft and Visa, allowing it to expand its operations across the African continent.",
      "Another area where mid-sized VCs are exploring opportunities is in industries that have lagged in adopting digital technologies. Sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and education still have a long way to go in terms of digital transformation, making them ripe for disruption — though one might argue that the transformation that happened in each sector is mostly superficial. Mid-sized VCs can identify startups with unique business models and technologies that are poised to revolutionize these industries, thus securing a foothold in the market before it matures.",
      "Additionally, mid-sized VCs are increasingly focusing on niche markets and verticals that may have been overlooked by larger funds. For example, investments in deep tech and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and blockchain could offer another interesting angle as these fields continue to develop. Similar to the dot com-bust of the 2000s, if we all listened to naysayers, Facebook and other Web2.0 startups would never have existed. In 2021, we heard about Web3, the blockchain technology that would transform our lives, the future of ownerships through non-fungible tokens or the future of securities through cryptocurrency. The following year, of course, everyone would say, “Look at how disappointing Web3 has turned out. These companies - FTX, Luna, and others are scamming all of us!”",
      "I don’t want to simplify these events, but as I mentioned earlier in the book, there are always some bad apples (read: crooks) in the midst. However, as the landscape changes, new companies will emerge and some will fade away. The ecosystem will continue to have a significant impact on the world, with the most successful companies standing out. Let’s reminisce about this. Remember the feeling the first time you interacted with a chat box, browsing the early World Wide Web and its iteration with smart algorithms to precisely find what you’re looking for, or downloading your first app on a smart device? Those early days of getting tactile with technology was so exciting and it seemed we got hooked on tech within minutes. It is such an integral part of us, nobody can remember phone numbers anymore. And with it comes a promise of bigger and better things, just wait until they code the program, turning 0 into 1 and end all wars. Okay maybe I pushed the envelope with the latter, but I have seen how lives have changed mostly for the better with innovation and tech. The folks who started the mission also started with a dream and a program in a place where it began. For the late Steve Jobs, it was when he was a 12 year old kid interning for Hewlett Packard that he saw the possibilities of machines and men. Elon Musk and his younger brother, meanwhile, tinkered with an online yellow pages directory at a young age, which became a business that was later purchased by Compaq for $22 million. They were in the right place, at the right time, with the right mind. True, not everybody has such a fair advantage; not everybody can intern at a mega corp and put two and two together and be struck by an ‘aha!’ moment. But everybody can put two and two together and grip technology by the balls and hit on people’s nerves in a good way. Tech now is accessible and abundant, and relatively cheap. Everybody can stay informed about the latest trends and developments in technology, and be willing to take risks and think outside the box.",
      "Whether it’s through starting a technology-based business, investing in emerging technologies, or developing a new app or software, there are many ways to make it big in the economy of bits. It’s an exciting time to be a part of the tech industry, and with the right mindset and approach, anyone can achieve success in this dynamic and ever changing field. Total meritocracy.",
      "Turn your ‘unfair advantage’ into a ’fair’ one. Use what you know and what you have, and marry them off with technology. Where you are, what you have, what you have experienced, who you know, what you need, what’s bugging you, what’s making you happy — all those are things that can be leveraged when innovating. When you have processed all that, certain with your truths, know what tech you want to employ to propel the product or service, that is when you see things on a higher ground. Through the eyes of a lazy boy, with a cigar in one hand and a double single malt in another. Crisis oftentimes leads to new innovation and the emergence of resilient companies. One study, published in the Harvard Business Review, found that, “companies that are built to last through a crisis are more likely to thrive in the long term.” The study analyzed companies that had been in business for at least 100 years and found that they had a number of characteristics in common, including strong leadership, a clear sense of purpose, and the ability to adapt to change.",
      "The concept of “anti-fragility” developed by Nassim Taleb, in his book Anti-fragile: Things That Gain from Disorder, suggests that some systems actually benefit from stressors and shocks, such as economic downturns. He argues that anti-fragile systems are able to learn and adapt, making them more robust and resilient in the face of uncertainty. The current state of the Southeast Asian digital economy really reflects this. They remain despite the constant ever evolving consumer needs, technological advancements, and shifting regulatory frameworks. These innovative tech startups inspire others embracing similar paths of entrepreneurship and value creation. Corporates are now more open to experimenting with new ideas as well as leveraging technology to drive efficiency and build resilience within their organizations. Cash rich startups continue to explore and build better foundations. This culture enabled companies in Southeast Asia to remain competitive in the global market.",
      "Negative bubble can also have societal benefits. The telecom bubble of the late 90’s resulted in a greatly expanded footprint of fiber-optic cables laid out in both the US and international markets to many overzealous investors and entrepreneurs’ chagrin. That rapid expansion bursted energy, enthusiasm, and investment dollars. Google and Facebook benefited from the bubble burst which created an opening for them to shine and establish their dominance in the market. The economy is cyclical; it goes through periods of growth and contraction. Private funding raises capital through the sale of securities to a small group of investors rather than to the public, but it is closely tied to these macroeconomic conditions. When the economy fluctuates, the availability and flow of private funding cheapens. And when the market cools off, everything becomes expensive, and somewhat chaotic. When chaos strikes, cash is king, reserve cash for impending crisis, round and round we go.",
      "As the storm of crisis made landfall, a legion of VCs held fast, proclaiming their unshakeable faith, some even predicting the apocalyptic end of VC as we know it. Then, a few brave ones ventured down the less trodden path, evangelizing the next hotbed of growth - AI and Web3. But the truth is - no one had a crystal ball. Not until mid-2024 for Indonesia at least, after the presidential elections dust settled. VCs with a vintage fund from 2021 faced a veritable gauntlet — deploying their funds now felt like a Herculean task, leaving them wondering if they needed to pivot to other regions or sectors.",
      "Still, to keep hope alive for our corner of the world, optimism remained key. Yet, a hearty dose of realism, a mirror-check on sanity, was essential. This includes rectifying our own blunders in the metrics we used for calculating these astronomical valuations. In the halcyon days, monthly active users were the holy grail, the undeniable proof of validation. This metric morphed into GMV multiple, then revenue multiple, and most recently, the EBITDA multiple. Our commitment to the chameleon-like shift in methodologies necessitates equivalent dedication to course correction, lest we tarnish the next cycle with our negligence. They say: “scarcity is the mother of— invention” or “necessity is the mother of innovation” highlights that difficult times can lead to creativity and progress. When faced with a lack of resources — whether it be time, money, or manpower — people are forced to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions that may otherwise never have been considered. The same holds true for businesses when they experience moments of disruption and uncertainty. By embracing these moments as opportunities to find new ways of doing things, companies can become more agile, open minded and better prepared for future challenges. Facebook, Twitter, and Dropbox were founded after the dot-com bust of 2001. The founders of these companies were able to identify a need in the market and create new solutions that ultimately led to their success. Similarly, companies such as Airbnb, Uber, and Slack were born after the global financial crisis of 2008.",

In an era where Google was just a fledgling and Wikipedia didn’t exist, information about him was as elusive as a four-leaf clover. I’d sit there, curiously pondering the man behind the message. What was it like being Steve Case? Did he share a camaraderie with other tech titans like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs? Perhaps even a rivalry with Paul Allen? Ah, the mysteries of the dial-up days! I’ve always been hooked on dystopian novels like George Orwell’s 1984, written in 1949, and spent my teen years watching the mind-bending world of A Clockwork Orange. When I first stumbled upon the internet and started playing around with it, I quickly realized this thing was going to shake up not just how we behave, but also how generations would connect, share, and think.",
      "Web 1.0 wasn’t just about bringing people together; it let anyone create their own digital hangout, like personal websites or blogs, without needing a nod from newspapers or media bigwigs.

      "It wasn’t just about changing the game; it was revolutionary.",
      "With the internet, you could suddenly access tons of content that used to be off-limits. True or false, you had the freedom to explore, question, and decide what to believe. I found myself utterly captivated by reading all the random stuff I found online. Once I got hooked on an idea, I’d dig up more references and even buy books on Amazon or Yahoo Shopping – yup, they had an e-commerce thing going on too. I’d also check out different opinions in blog comments and join in on the chatter. And when Wikipedia launched in 2001, well, that just took things to a whole new level. I was in awe. You might not think much of it, but the advancement made by encyclopedias in the 18th century was the democratization of knowledge and marked a shift towards the Age of Enlightenment, where reason and science were prioritized in the pursuit of knowledge.",

It was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d’Alembert and contained contributions from over 140 contributors. The publication aimed to collect and organize all human knowledge in a single work. It included articles on a wide range of subjects, from science and technology to philosophy, politics, and the arts.",

    "DISRUPTING DISRUPTORS": [
      "NOT sure if any of you remember a Wired Magazine headline back in September of 2010 that read, “The Web is Dead.” At the time, it seemed like a bold and surprising statement, especially considering the context in which it was made. Social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, were just beginning to take shape and gain traction among internet users.",
      "Facebook, which was founded in 2004, began as a basic website aimed at connecting people, enabling users to create profiles, connect with friends, share photos, and communicate through status updates and messages. Similarly, Twitter, founded in 2006, offered a mini-blog platform for users to express thoughts, share poetry, post updates, and engage with others through 280-character “tweets.” It was the dawn of the next decade that saw these platforms explode in popularity, thanks largely to the rise of mobile applications. With smartphones and other mobile devices becoming ubiquitous, users found it increasingly convenient to access their favorite social media platforms through dedicated apps rather than visiting websites on a computer. This shift in user behavior propelled Facebook and Twitter from simple websites to powerful, feature-rich platforms reaching billions worldwide.",
      "The rapid growth of mobile applications profoundly altered the way people interacted with the internet, rendering Wired Magazine’s once-bold claim almost prophetic. Social media platforms and mobile apps took center stage, revolutionizing the web.",
      "For me, it was 2011 when the true impact of this transformation became unmistakable. The Arab Spring, a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions sweeping through the Arab world, was significantly influenced and facilitated by social media platforms and mobile applications. Facebook and Twitter played crucial roles in organizing, communicating, and disseminating information during these events, highlighting Web 2.0’s impact on society and its ability to reshape the political and societal landscape.",
      "Starting in Tunisia in December 2010, the Arab Spring quickly spread to countries like Egypt, Libya, and Syria. Social media’s role in these events cannot be overstated. Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms gave citizens an unprecedented ability to share information, organize protests, and communicate globally. Mobile applications further enabled these activities by making social media platforms more accessible, even in areas with limited internet connectivity. Both activists and ordinary citizens used these tools to expose government corruption, human rights abuses, and political repression. The information quickly gained traction among local and international audiences, amplifying calls for change and pressuring authoritarian regimes. Social media often served as a catalyst for mobilization, inspiring people who might otherwise have hesitated to join protests. The transformative power of Web 2.0 extended beyond political and social movements to other areas where inclusivity and accessibility were promoted. In the realm of education, e-learning platforms like Coursera and Khan Academy democratized access to high-quality courses by offering free online classes from renowned institutions. This development enabled people from all walks of life to learn new skills and broaden their horizons, breaking down financial and geographic barriers that once limited educational opportunities.",
      "Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo empowered people and small businesses to bring their projects to life by connecting them with backers from around the globe. By harnessing the power of the internet and social media, these platforms have made it possible for innovative ideas to flourish, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and democratizing access to capital.",
      "Web 2.0 ushered in an era where anyone with an internet connection could become a content creator, a business owner, or even a revolutionary. The digital landscape morphed into a boundless playground of possibilities, where our imagination and the reach of our fingertips were the only constraints. This surge of empowerment reshaped the world, and one of the most profound outcomes of this disruption is the revolutionary concept of the sharing economy. The sharing economy was like a utopian dream come true. Picture something akin to a Star Trek society where resources are shared harmoniously, trust runs deep, and collaboration is the name of the game. From finding a cozy abode in a foreign land with Airbnb, to hitching a ride like you’re in a Twilight Zone episode via Uber, and even sharing workspaces through platforms like WeWork - the sharing economy was transforming how we interacted with one another.",
      "This shift hasn’t just changed consumer behavior, but generational thinking as well. For instance, millennials often prefer not to own cars, opting for ride sharing services instead. Similarly, many choose to rent clothing and accessories through platforms like Rent the Runway, embracing a more sustainable and flexible lifestyle.",
      "At its core, the sharing economy seemed like a society changing tool that encouraged us to trust one another, collaborate on a gig-economy, and reconsider our ideas of ownership and consumption. By promoting resource-sharing and community-building, the sharing economy fosters a culture where we look out for each other and work together to shape a better, more inclusive world. However, it’s essential to acknowledge that Web 2.0 hasn’t been an entirely smooth ride. The same platforms that have empowered people and fostered connections have also given rise to issues like frauds, privacy concerns and misinformation. As we navigate the complexities of modern society, there is still much work to be done through the internet. Especially if we believe that technology itself is fundamental to the sovereignty of each individual, it’s crucial to continue striving for an equitable future for all humanity."

    "ENTER WEB3": [
      "AS you have probably seen, Web2.0 has a lot of sh*t going on, from fake news running rampant to privacy scandals making headlines and social media fueling divisiveness, financial manipulations, cyberbullying — we’ve seen it all. But let’s not forget the romanticization of the internet found in works like George Orwell’s 1984, A Clockwork Orange, and the Matrix universe. These dystopian tales hinted at the potential for the internet to empower humanity, yet self-governance remains an elusive dream.",
      "In the face of these challenges, the concept of decentralizing the internet has long been a topic of discussion among tech enthusiasts and visionaries alike. The idea is simple: wrest control from the hands of a few powerful entities and distribute it more evenly among users, fostering a more democratic digital ecosystem. We’ve seen this spark of hope manifest in various forms, from the early days of the internet with peer-to-peer networks like Napster to more recent blockchain-based technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As we stand at the precipice of change, the evolution from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 presents an opportunity to reimagine our digital lives. With its focus on decentralization, Web 3.0 promises to empower individuals, protect privacy, and potentially dismantle the monopolies that have dominated the online world for far too long.",
      "Maybe we don’t need someone to tell us what to do after all?",
      "First, let’s wrap our heads around the concept of cryptocurrency. Picture a currency that exists beyond the constraints of financial institutions, government control, or any centralized authority. Envision a digital asset that can be exchanged for tangible goods and services, without pesky intermediaries or fluctuating exchange rates. In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, trust in traditional financial systems was shattered. Enter Bitcoin, stage left. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin emerged as a decentralized currency that promised to revolutionize the way we view and use money. Starting at a price of $0 per Bitcoin, this digital currency was created with a deflationary mechanism, meaning there would only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. The scarcity principle, combined with its decentralized nature, quickly turned Bitcoin into a symbol of hope for a more equitable financial future. But how does Bitcoin work, and why is it the currency of tomorrow? Well, Bitcoin operates on a groundbreaking technology called blockchain. This innovative system allows for secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. Instead, a network of computers (called nodes) work together to validate and record transactions in a digital ledger that is accessible to all. The result? Faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions, all while promoting financial inclusion and granting users greater control over their assets. Enter smart contracts and other blockchain-enabled solutions, which started making waves in the market around the mid-2010s. These innovations fueled chatter about investment through tokenization, a process that eliminates the need for middlemen in various transactions. Just as cryptocurrencies don’t require central banks, tokenized investments sidestep the need for investment bankers, venture capitalists, and other financial intermediaries. In this brave new world, transactions are built on a digital ledger that promotes transparency, security, and efficiency. Web3 has been causing quite a stir in the tech industry as the next step in the internet revolution, poised to disrupt the status quo and empower the masses yearning for change. And thanks to blockchain, the dream of a digital utopia is closer than ever.",
      "There was even this talk about tokenized investment, where companies raise funds through Decentralized Finance (DeFi) allowing founders to access liquidity without the need of traditional intermediaries. The advantages of DeFi include faster transaction times, increased transparency, and more accessible to a wider range of investors. Imagine graduating college, but instead of a degree, you receive an NFT/token. This NFT/token is stored in a crypto wallet and everyone can see which college you graduated from. If someone tries to copy or sell it, it will fail because there will be a visible history of who sent it to you. This concept of NFTs/tokens creates a sense of ownership and provides a way for passionate buyers to have a stake in the project they are investing in. Another concept that has emerged in the Web3 space is the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT). SAFTs are a type of investment contract that were devised as a means of assisting new cryptocurrency ventures to raise capital without violating financial regulations, particularly regulations that govern the classification of an investment as a security. Is this going to be the end of conventional startups through VC wanting to exit through an IPO?",
      "The internet has turned us into citizens of a borderless digital world. Algorithms have been developed to cater to our desires and needs. Social media platforms, on-demand services, and OTT streaming services all rely on our data to curate personalized experiences. However, the underlying theme here is that we’re constantly giving our information to providers, intermediaries, developers, and the big brothers — the middlemen. Enter Web3, the digital revolution that aims to kick these middlemen to the curb, and restore power to the people. By the way, VCs are middlemen too, come to think of it. I thought it was bold when a VC like a16z announced their new $4.5 billion, with $1.5 billion of it dedicated for Web3 projects amid the 2022 market crash. As a VC myself, I’d likely adopt a similar strategy, considering there wasn’t much left to explore in traditional startup investments (read: Web2). Just like the post dot-com bust in 2000, VCs didn’t clamor for another Amazon or eBay; instead, they dived headfirst into the next chapter of the internet revolution, exploring social media, cloud computing, and mobile apps. Of course, there were exceptions — niche e-commerce ventures and other long-tail opportunities. I’ve mentioned before that VCs are like nomads and herds, always chasing the next growth — be it sectoral, geographical, or generational.",
      "Some Indonesian VCs tried to ride this trend, launching their Web3 funds during 2021-2022, jostling to place their bets on the latest craze. One VC even had the audacity to announce a Web3 fund with a corpus of $100 million, but failed to make any significant deals post-announcement — duh! In fact, some departed partners confided in me, saying that the announcement was merely a flashy façade. The “show” was meant to lure more LPs into the fund. It’s a fairly common strategy for VCs to bolster credibility when raising a fund: “If these guys have $100 million, they must be legit. Let’s put $ 5-10 million into their hands,” an unsuspecting LP might think. And just like that, the show goes on. I will discuss this in the next chapter. The notion of a Web3 fund in Southeast Asia, or specifically Indonesia, is somewhat silly. We don’t even have enough engineers for Web2, let alone Web3. Remember when some of the major unicorns had to outsource their engineering talent to India?",
      "Though the promise of Web3 might be tempting, and I have no doubt that a fresh wave of entrepreneurs will claim to have innovative blockchain solutions for the masses, one nagging question remains: Are we going to outsource our entire engineering team to Bangalore? And will they be tech wizards or just code monkeys?",
      "Realistically speaking, even mature markets like the US may not be fully prepared for the Web3 revolution. Given the ongoing pressure on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from governments worldwide, the path to decentralized digital currencies remains fraught with challenges. As the pioneer of the crypto movement, Bitcoin has faced regulatory scrutiny, tax implications, and concerns about its potential use in illegal activities. These issues only add to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the future of digital currencies and Web3. Transferring control to the masses could lead to chaos and disorder. It would be the end of the world as we know it — which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, mind you. It’s worth noting that the shift from Web 2.0 to Web3 will not happen overnight, and there will be a gradual progression as new technologies and paradigms are adopted. The next possible scenario would be the gradual phasing out of Web 2.0 into a hypothetical Web2.9, a gradual evolution of the internet from its current state towards the more decentralized vision of Web3.",
      "This phase might include the development and adoption of technologies that would gradually transition the internet towards a more decentralized and user-centric model, as envisioned by Web3.",
      "In this Web 2.9 period, we could witness the emergence of hybrid models, where both centralized and decentralized systems coexist and interact with one another. During this transition, we might see new applications, platforms, and services that incorporate decentralized elements (like blockchain and decentralized storage) while still maintaining some of the centralized structures we’re familiar with today.",
      "Companies like Grab, Traveloka, SEA, and Gojek have all shown interest in blockchain and Web3 solutions. Grab, for example, has acquired several blockchain and fintech startups, including Bento Invest and CoinHako, and has launched its own cryptocurrency, GrabCoin. They are also exploring the use of blockchain technology for payment processing and supply chain management.",
      "Traveloka has partnered with blockchain-based hotel booking platform Winding Tree to explore the use of decentralized platforms in the travel industry. They are also reportedly exploring the use of blockchain technology for loyalty programs and data management.",
      "SEA, which owns the popular e-commerce platform Shopee, has launched its own blockchain platform, SeaX, which aims to provide secure and transparent data management solutions for businesses in Southeast Asia. They are also exploring the use of blockchain technology for supply chain management and cross-border payments. The advent of blockchain technology has given rise to various movements and platforms intent on shaking up the traditional investment landscape. They aim to dethrone fund managers by empowering individuals to make investments through the use of tokens. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one such groundbreaking force, enabling people to dive into financial markets using blockchain-based tokens, all without needing the middlemen — the fund managers, and their hefty fees.",
      "Moreover, an array of platforms has sprung up to facilitate token-based investments. Security token offering (STO) platforms, tokenized investment funds, and security token exchanges all help streamline the process. In a world where fund managers are about as welcome as an expired coupon, these platforms offer a refreshing alternative. Allow me to dispel any illusions you may have—investing in tokens isn’t all candy floss dreams and fairytale unicorns. The reality can be more akin to a turbulent roller coaster ride through the Wild West. Token values oscillate wildly, often with all the predictability of a temperamental wind, and the regulatory framework surrounding token-based investments is murkier than a dense foggy morning in London. Sure, the star-studded era of Web3 and cryptocurrency will have its moment under the sun, but not before the surging tide of generative AI solutions and applications leaves its indelible mark. Cast your mind back to 2017 when AI was the shiny new toy everyone couldn’t get enough of. However, the needle of the tech sector barely twitched. Fast forward to 2020, and blockchain and crypto usurped the throne, quickly followed by the enigmatic metaverse and Web3. And now, like a boomerang, we find ourselves circling back to AI. Investment behaviors have started to resemble a frenetic carousel ride, hopping on and off various trends with reckless abandon. It feels like a dizzying cycle of chasing our tails, an endless loop of trend chasing without any tangible progress. It’s high time we hopped off this merry-go-round and took a moment to catch our breath.",
      "But before we dive into the immense potential of AI and Web3 technologies in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, we must first make sure that their uses are firmly rooted in addressing our existing needs. It’s not about creating a new momentum to chase after, but more into the question should not just be about why these technologies are important, but rather, how they can be utilized to address our current challenges, especially the process of doing businesses that hadn’t been completely addressed in the Web 2.0 –  you know the like of false promises of P2P, on-demand logistics, etc. Are these advanced solutions truly what we need right now? It's crucial to take into account our local customs, traditions, and infrastructure. Will these technologies be welcomed and integrated into our current societal framework, or will they disrupt the balance that we've maintained? How much will they change our traditional ways, and will these changes bring more benefits or challenges?",
      "In essence, the goal of technological progress shouldn't just be for the sake of shaking things up. We should also think about how these changes will impact our daily lives and the way our society functions. We need to ensure that these transformations aren't just revolutionary in terms of technology, but also in terms of improving our inefficient process and more importantly not creating new, potentially more complicated issues while trying to solve the old ones."

To maintain momentum, there’s little incentive for them to be honest about what’s happening within their companies. So everything seems fine until it’s not. In one particularly memorable instance, during a final meeting with a startup in around 2017, the founder informed the investors, including myself and 5-6 others, about shutting down the company. The investors, a mix of angels and VCs, offered encouraging comments like, “We understand the hardships you faced,” and so on. When it was my turn to share my opinion, I couldn’t help but call out the years of cover-ups that had taken place. Surprisingly, this particular founder managed to bounce back, starting a new company with the same set of investors who had witnessed the previous venture’s downfall. Resilience, it seems, goes a long way. Years later, the company repeated the same mistakes, and this time, they conveniently blamed the Covid-19 pandemic for their demise. In Silicon Valley, failures are often encouraged. The “Fail Fast Mantra” — fail fast, fail forward or fail fast, fail cheap — has become a popular rallying cry.",

But in this part of the world, it’s really about chasing easy money and maintaining appearances, rather than embracing the trials and tribulations that can lead to genuine progress and long-term success. In many cultures across the globe, failure remains an uninvited guest, the proverbial elephant in the room. Instead of embracing the harsh yet indispensable lessons that setbacks bring, there exists a preference for the dazzling mirage of relentless triumphs, birthing a culture that is expert at playing hide and seek with its flaws. Transparency often gets assigned to the backseat, only allowed to ride shotgun when crises are on the horizon, and there’s no other option left.",
      "Imagine this — in the thick of 2023, a plethora of VCs were shy of entertaining the idea of a down round, that necessary evil often referred to as a “correction” of what many deemed as inflated valuations. Take company “X” as an example - sporting a valuation north of half a billion dollars, courtesy of its latest funding round, despite revenue that was but a speck on this colossal figure. “We’d rather see it become a zombie, gradually written off over the next few years than slash the valuation by half,” confessed one fund manager, “Going down that road could ripple through our entire portfolio. I’m sure you get the picture.” This hesitance to pull back the curtain on failure, to truly accept and learn from it, may very well be a generational challenge. It may take one more round on the carousel of years, perhaps even longer, to fully address and overcome this aversion.",
      "However, heed my words. The upcoming years will likely witness the deflation of extravagant unicorn valuations, a liquidity crisis, and a downturn in specific sectors. Some of these changes may already be in motion behind closed doors, yet to be revealed to the public eye.",
      "Such shifts are not just possibilities, but rather an expected part of the evolutionary process in the startup ecosystem. They serve as reminders for entrepreneurs and investors to remain resilient, adaptable, and vigilant. While the landscape may seem daunting, it is in navigating through these complexities that we find opportunities for genuine learning and growth.",
      "So, when people ask me, “Hey Nicko, what do you think the next big thing is? Which verticals should we be looking at?” Typically, my response is: “You’re asking the wrong question. It’s not about which verticals to focus on, but rather who will be leading these emerging verticals” and obviously, “who will be their backers/early investors?” This industry has consistently driven a sense of FOMO among uninformed investors who are eager to join the next big trend. As a result, they often dive headfirst into specific verticals without fully understanding the true value of the people behind the business.",
      "What truly matters in the ever-evolving world of technology and innovation is not just the industry or vertical itself, but the visionaries leading the charge. Exceptional founders and management teams possess (a very rare combination, if you’d ask me) the ability to pivot, adapt, and succeed in the face of challenges and changing market conditions. It is these individuals who ultimately determine the long-term success and viability of a business, regardless of the vertical in which it operates. Rather than focusing solely on the next promising tech vertical, savvy investors should pay close attention to the people steering the ship. By prioritizing the talent, leadership, and resilience of the individuals behind the startups, investors stand a better chance of identifying the true game-changers and the most lucrative opportunities in the ever-changing landscape of technology and innovation.",
      "Whether its Web2-point-something or Web3, disrupting or complementing, the challenge remains that this industry still needs more experienced founders to scale up. More actual work and less talk."

  "CHAPTER NINE: THE INEXORABLE MOMENTUM": {
    "THE INEXORABLE": [
      "AS we stand on the brink of another internet revolution, there’s an elephant in the room we can’t ignore: how to mend the battered and bruised ecosystem that has been through the wringer. While I’ll dive deeper into this subject in the concluding chapter of this book, for now, let’s delve into the current state of the ecosystem in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, exploring its unique dynamics and complexities. Let me start by unraveling the enigma of how VCs get their money. We’ll examine why they receive funds, what mandates they follow, who the LPs are, and how these relationships shape the investment landscape. I feel it’s important to shine the spotlight on the financial fuel that powers the VC engine, and we’ll circle back to the startups at the heart of this dynamic later in the discussion. To kick things off, it’s essential to understand that VC firms are financial intermediaries, channeling funds from their investors, the LPs, into the promising startups they believe have the potential to strike gold. In more mature markets like the U.S, Japan, and European countries, these LPs can include pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, high-net worth individuals, and even governments — all investing in the hope of high returns on their capital. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors, such as differences in market maturity, regulatory environments, and the overall appetite for risk.",
      "In mature markets, LPs often have a longer history of exposure to VC investments and are more familiar with the potential risks and rewards. Regulatory environments in these regions also tend to be more developed and transparent, providing a sense of security for LPs when making investments. In contrast, Indonesia’s relatively young VC industry, combined with a less developed regulatory framework, may deter potential LPs from committing substantial funds.",
      "The mandate of a VC firm often revolves around identifying and investing in specific industries, geographies, or stages of business development. Guided by their mandate, VCs scout for promising startups, perform due diligence, negotiate deals, and ultimately, provide the financial backing and strategic guidance these fledgling businesses need to soar to new heights.",
      "Additionally, the overall appetite for risk in mature markets is often greater, as LPs have accumulated more experience and have a better understanding of the potential returns on their investments. In contrast, the relatively nascent state of the Indonesian market may cause hesitation among potential LPs, as the risk-reward profile of VC investments may not be as well understood. I may have already dropped a few breadcrumbs in previous chapters regarding the industry’s “tactics” for attracting funds from both VCs and startups, but none of this would have transpired without the perfect storm of circumstances that swept across the region, and worldwide, and the impeccable timing that set the stage for rapid growth and investment opportunities."

    "“SOMETHING VENTURED”": [
      "I fondly recall screening the 2011 documentary about the birth of venture capital in Silicon Valley, titled Something Ventured, during my teaching residency at UPH Business School. At the time, I was on the lookout for enthusiastic students to join my new VC firm, Systec Ventures, as budget friendly analysts. Naturally, these fresh graduates needed training, and many were as young as 21, hailing from middle upper-class backgrounds that could afford the $10,000 per year tuition fee. The documentary Something Ventured never failed to pique students’ curiosity about the industry. Bear in mind, this was 2011 when the term “unicorn” hadn’t gained worldwide recognition, and “startup” was practically unknown. “Something Ventured” recounts the story of the young VC industry in the 70s with Arthur Rock (Davis & Rock), Tom Perkins (KPCB), Don Valentine (Sequoia Capital), Mike Markkula (angel investor and the first investor of Apple). It tells the story of the venture capitalist industry in Silicon Valley, focusing on the pioneers who helped shape the industry in the 60s and 70s. The documentary explores the early days of venture capitalism, highlighting the role of key players in the success of companies such as Apple, Intel, and Cisco. The film also examines the risk-taking culture of venture capitalism, which involves investing in untested, innovative technologies that could potentially change the world.",
      "It was history in the making. I remember inviting one of Gojek’s founders — no, not the Minister, but the other one — to speak in my class, and none of the students had heard of him (or even the minister’s name), let alone Gojek. However, the documentary left a lasting impression on them throughout the semester, and a handful of them decided to follow me from Systec Ventures to MDI Ventures and eventually to BRI Ventures. The “experiment” endures through various hypotheses, countless trials and tribulations, conflicts, and perhaps after a decade, I can pen the industry’s conclusion based on my observations and lessons learned from my team that has been with me since day one.",
      "Allow me to share a small observation of three students from the same campus. They all possess unique personalities, hobbies, and interests. Later, I’ll draw comparisons between these students and other fresh graduates who joined me under similar circumstances, such as guest lectures, seminars, workshops, and more.",
      "I’ve been fortunate enough to witness the evolution of this industry and its phenomena from the early days, which has granted me valuable insights into the driving forces behind its formation and the resulting byproducts. This unique vantage point has allowed me to explore the intricate workings and patterns that have shaped the industry over time, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the working culture, motivation/demotivation, their perspectives on success, and much more.",
      "Three students, for the sake of this discussion, we’ll call them Student ”A,” “B,” and “C,” joined my venture capital f irms – Systec Ventures, MDI Ventures, and BRI Ventures – each coming on board in separate years.",
      "Student “A,” whom I met in 2010, was in his final year during my teaching residency in 2011. At that point in his life, he was contemplating whether to work for his father’s asset management company. Though an average student academically, he exuded confidence when delivering presentations. Over a couple of weeks, he visited my office at Systec Ventures multiple times, driven by curiosity about the activities of a VC firm. During each visit, we would sit down for coffee and discuss what the next decade might hold for Indonesia’s digital startups, often referencing “Something Ventured” as a touchstone for our conversations. Student “A” was trainable — in the early days of this ecosystem, one didn’t need to be a straight-A student to learn the ropes; a basic understanding of finance was sufficient. Student “B” joined the team later in 2011. A quiet and diligent type, he didn’t say much in class, but his comprehensive understanding of the subject shone through during exams. His essay writing demonstrated his ability to construct elaborate arguments, keen attention to detail, and an aptitude for critical thinking. Intrigued by his potential, I invited him to join our venture during the mid-semester, informing him that he needn’t attend class for the rest of the term and could start drawing a salary immediately. With a hint of surprise, he accepted the offer, marking the beginning of his journey in the world of venture capital — a journey where his analytical prowess would be put to good use. Student “C” joined the team in 2014, during my final teaching residency. Keep in mind that between 2010 and 2014, more than a dozen students had come and gone, serving as interns or associates. Student “C” was perhaps a bit below average, with a somewhat limited awareness of the world beyond the campus bubble. Raised near the university, his experiences were relatively sheltered. Despite this, he joined MDI Ventures as an intern with a strong determination to prove himself. He spent two years in the role, aspiring to become a full-fledged associate among his peers. Fueled by ambition, he worked tirelessly to achieve that status, showing an impressive drive to learn and excel among his peers. In the early days, there wasn’t much competition in the VC landscape. Many of the students’ peers were practically invisible within the industry. However, as the years rolled by, particularly from 2016 onward, the situation began to change. Suddenly, numerous individuals from their age group emerged as prominent figures in the field. The industry was no longer a quiet, exclusive club, but rather a thriving, competitive arena teeming with ambitious young professionals eager to make their mark. Venture capitalism, though, isn’t a one-size-fits-all affair. Adopting the rules of the game from other regions and blindly applying them to Southeast Asia and Indonesia is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The landscape requires careful navigation, meticulous adaptation. And as the world is increasingly leaning towards profitability, investment strategies should pivot from a single-minded pursuit of scale to a balance of sustainability and multiplicity.",
      "The tightrope of moral hazards is a daily challenge for both VC and CVC fund managers. VCs must resist the siren song of carry incentives, ensuring expectations are aligned with reality, and disclose any looming issues to future investors, rather than concealing them in a misguided quest for carry interest. For CVCs, fund managers need to maintain a delicate equilibrium - they aren’t merely emissaries of the parent company but full-fledged fund managers with an obligation to profitability. The balancing act is tricky, but it’s the only way to walk this high-wire industry. This is Something Ventured; and the story continues."
    ],
    "THE INSIDE MEN": [
      "FOR those of you who aren’t familiar with the way venture capitalists are compensated, let me break it down for you. The most common payment structure is the so-called “2/20” model, with variations like 1.5/25 or 1/30 also being quite popular.",
      "In the 2/20 model, VCs receive a 2% management fee of the total fund managed over the investment period, and 20% of the carried interest after taxes and weighted average of the cost. Some venture capitalists opt for a higher upside, such as 30% carried interest at a 1% management fee, to demonstrate their commitment to the fund and show that they have some real skin in the game. CVC compensation works a little differently. CVCs usually follow the compensation structure of their parent company, which also serves as the sole or anchor limited partner in the fund. While management fees for CVCs can vary, they’re often less than the 2% typically seen in traditional VC firms. Carried interest incentives for CVCs also differ. It’s rare for a CVC to have a carried interest of 20% or more, if any carried interest compensation is agreed upon at all. The bottom line is that nobody makes more money managing a fund at a CVC than they do at a traditional VC.",
      "In fact, I know of a couple of CVCs that don’t allow carried interest compensation at all. Instead, they offer company bonuses, which are awarded regardless of investment performance — come rain or shine. After nearly a decade in CVC and interacting with the dynamics, I’ve come to realize that the traditional 2/20 model may not be the perfect fit for an emerging ecosystem. VC investment inherently involves a degree of risk, and the 2/20 model provides sufficient incentive for both VC and CVC fund managers to either bet on a winning horse or mitigate risks associated with their overall portfolio. However, for smaller funds — those with AUM ranging from $10 million to $50 million — the 2/20 model can be somewhat challenging in a booming market.",
      "Picture this: you’re managing a maiden fund of $10 million in 2015, and following the 2/20 model. It’s an ideal time to start a VC fund, as the landscape is bustling with activity — unicorns are emerging, and prospective investors (who will become your limited partners) no longer require a crash course in the potential of the startup ecosystem. A $200,000 management fee to run your fund might not be enough to cover your expenses. To make up for this, you rely on the 20% carried interest incentive. Consequently, fund managers are motivated to maximize the return on investment as much as possible, often without considering the long-term sustainability of such growth.",
      "As the focus becomes solely on immediate returns — on paper, this can lead to neglecting the bigger picture of fostering a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for startups and investors alike.",
      "Another conundrum facing VCs is that, with the 2/20 model, you essentially become an “insider” or an “inside man” in the ecosystem, privy to information about which deals are hot and which are not. Sometimes, a seemingly fantastic deal can turn sour in just a few short months. As the risks associated with being an “inside man” unfold, you’re faced with the task of transforming the less-than-stellar deals into gold before the momentum fizzles out. This means managing your portfolio by holding on to the winners until they mature while quickly offloading the not-so-great investments. However, 2022 saw a peculiar phenomenon: everyone seemed to be unloading their investments simultaneously. This mass exodus, or “panic selling,” sent negative signals to the market and deterred other investors from participating in subsequent financing rounds for these startups. The result was a self-perpetuating cycle that further destabilized the ecosystem, making it even more challenging for startups and investors alike to navigate the turbulent waters. As venture capitalists are often seen as insiders with access to exclusive investment opportunities and information, it also implies a level of secrecy or exclusivity, which could further emphasize the mystique surrounding the industry. An additional challenge faced by VCs is juggling multiple funds under their management. Continuing from the previous example, let’s say your inaugural fund of $10 million had a successful deployment after two years. You’ve earned a reputation in the industry for being prudent, cautious, and meticulous in your investment decisions. With $3 million left from that initial fund, another substantial LP comes your way, offering to invest $20 million into your next venture. Naturally, you don’t want to pass up this opportunity. However, having not yet fully deployed your initial fund, welcoming an additional $20 million means you need to craft a distinct investment thesis. Failing to do so could lead to discontent among the investors in your first fund, as they may feel that the new fund will compete with their existing investments — yes, investments they’ve already entrusted you to manage. Thus, it’s not unusual for hot startups to have 3-4 investments from the same VC firm but different funds on their cap table. These investors or LPs are eager to latch onto the next big thing and, understandably, want to maintain their stake in promising companies. It’s also not uncommon to have local VC firms with multiple overlapping funds, not only with similar thesis from one fund to another, but investing on the same deals. The burning question remains: just how many scorching-hot deals are there coming from one emerging country or one region of the world?"
    ],
    "TRICKY, LIQUIDITY (PART 2)": [
      "IT is true that the VC industry is not required to make it difficult for LPs to assess the performance but we can make rough estimates about their return rates: calculate the current marked-to-market values of their portfolio companies, with the VC firm holding a percentage of equity. For example, if a VC firm has invested in two companies that are currently valued at $50 million each, and it holds 8-10% ownership in these companies, we can estimate that the “champion” portfolio companies of the VC firm are worth between $8 million and $10 million. This is just a rough estimate; it doesn’t take into account other factors such as the stage of the companies when they received funding, the size of the investment, and the performance of the other portfolio companies. Additionally, the estimate does not justify the $30 million to $50 million investment that LPs initially made. A booming market is a bipolar condition; when the valuation is high, investors are in a state of mania, all fancy and dandy, but when it drops, then comes the depressive mood like ‘catching a falling knife.’ The market boom could go on for another 18 months or so. It takes a Moksha to ride the fluctuations.",
      "Some successful VCs have managed to ride the wave of prosperity by diversifying their investments across various corners of the globe. One particularly impressive case study, in my view, is Vertex Holdings. This corporate venture arm of Singapore’s Temasek Holdings was established in 2004 and currently operates six global funds: Vertex Ventures China, Vertex Ventures Israel, Vertex Ventures SEA & India, Vertex Ventures US, Vertex Ventures HC, and Vertex Growth. Each of these funds targets early stage and growth-stage tech companies, operating independently with local teams managing their respective portfolios. This global approach has allowed Vertex Holdings to tap into the potential of emerging technologies and trends in diverse markets, significantly broadening their investment horizons. Their early funds have generated more than 70 exits, including the acquisition of Waze in Israel by Google in 2013 for a cool $1.3 billion. While this high-profile success story may have captured the attention of the masses, many of their other exits cater to niche markets in sectors like B2B, enterprise solutions, IoT, and other “less-sexy-deals”. These under-the-radar victories may not be as hugely celebrated, but they’re no less vital to the firm’s overall success — proving that sometimes, the most rewarding investments are those that fly just beneath the radar.",
      "It’s important to remember that the IPO route isn’t the only way for VCs to make their exit. Secondary trades and acquisitions are perhaps more common, while liquidation, though less desirable, does happen on occasions. Acquisitions can be a highly favorable exit scenario, and they don’t always have to be blockbuster deals. In fact, you’d rarely hear about unicorns getting acquired unless they’re in dire financial straits. The sweet spot for acquisitions in Southeast Asia tends to hover around the $100 million to $500 million mark; anything above this range may not be worth the effort. More often than not, acquisitions benefit both the buyer and early investors (angel investors, strategic investors, and VCs). These deals facilitate the transfer of technology, talent, and revenue for greater synergy. It’s worth noting that most acquisitions don’t involve an all-cash transaction but rather a mix of cash and stock swaps. For example, Kudo and Moka were acquired by Grab and Gojek, respectively, for $100 million each, with both deals involving a combination of cash and stock. Consequently, most of the founders and key team members stayed on for a “vesting period,” during which they were awarded stocks of the acquiring companies, in this case, Grab and Gojek.",
      "As for VCs, they’re typically given the option to cash out entirely or partially, with the remainder to be determined when their investment reaches maturity.",
      "For secondary trades, things can get tricky, to say the least. Let’s be clear: in secondary trades, the sellers come out on top. They win, and they win big.",
      "Acquisitions are quite different in that there’s less incentive for the buyer, especially when VCs buy secondary shares from other VCs. In these cases, the deal is primarily driven by FOMO. In essence, when a VC buys a secondary from another VC, they’re transferring risk, not seizing opportunity.",
      "To illustrate, let me paint a hypothetical picture for you, bearing in mind that this is purely fictional and may or may not reflect real-world scenarios: A holding VC firm oversees three funds, each operating independently and managing their respective portfolios. The year is 2023, and the holding VC firm calls the managing directors of Fund I, Fund II, and Fund III for a performance update.",
      "Fund Manager I: “It’s been a challenging year for all of us, with curve balls thrown at every turn, but we did manage one exit from our portfolio despite the uphill battle.” Holding CEO: “Oh, thank heavens you still managed an exit during these frosty times. Was it an acquisition?” Fund Manager I: “No, it’s a secondary sale. It’s not ideal, but we did secure a 3x money multiple on our investment in that particular deal.” Holding CEO: “A 3x money multiple isn’t half bad, considering the circumstances. Who bought it?” Fund Manager II: “We did.” Eyebrows raise in surprise as Fund Manager II continues, “We felt it would be a strategic play for our ecosystem. And we couldn’t find decent deals last year.” Fund Manager III: “...” In Bahasa Indonesia: kantong kiri, kantong kanan (left pocket goes to right pocket). No one wins."

      "“NOBODY knows when the bubble will burst!” Well, someone — on the inside — does. Just like market makers in the stock market know which companies will thrive and which ones will crash and burn. I’ll give you an example from the cryptocurrency world, as it’s a less contentious topic and my hypothesis remains debatable—meaning I could be utterly mistaken.",
      "Many of you Bitcoin hodlers might be eagerly awaiting the halving event in 2024, hoping to sell at a multiple of today’s price (around $28k). However, that’s the mindset of a retail investor. The selling might occur just before the halving event, at a different price altogether.",
      "A similar analogy can be drawn when a company is about to go public. The retail market follows the latest updates and information, often without a full understanding of the intricacies involved.",
      "In numerous instances, even the most seasoned VCs find themselves ensnared in their own overconfidence and misguided assumptions. Consequently, the situation circles back to their own missteps and miscalculations. Softbank Vision Fund, one of the most prominent and well-capitalized investment funds in the world, found itself grappling with the consequences of overconfidence and misguided assumptions. The Vision Fund had been instrumental in propelling numerous startups to unicorn status. However, its aggressive investment strategy and immense capital injections led to an inflated valuation bubble for many of its portfolio companies.",
      "One of the most striking examples of SoftBank Vision Fund’s overconfidence was its investment in WeWork, the flexible workspace provider. In January 2019, SoftBank invested an additional $2 billion into WeWork, raising its valuation to a staggering $47 billion. This astronomical valuation was primarily based on assumptions of rapid growth and expansion. However, the cracks in WeWork’s business model soon became apparent, and its planned IPO in 2019 was ultimately shelved. By 2022, WeWork’s valuation had plummeted to around $9 billion, forcing SoftBank to write down its investment and leading to the ousting of WeWork’s CEO, Adam Neumann. Another example is SoftBank’s investment in the ride hailing company, Uber. SoftBank Vision Fund had been a major investor in Uber, and while the company went public in May 2019, its stock price struggled to gain momentum. By 2022, concerns around profitability, regulatory challenges, and increasing competition led to a drop in Uber’s valuation. This resulted in significant paper losses for SoftBank Vision Fund and raised questions about its investment strategy and decision-making.",
      "The Vision Fund’s overconfidence in its ability to pick winners and its willingness to inject massive amounts of capital into its portfolio companies created a distorted market environment. This overcapitalization led to unsustainable valuations and growth expectations, ultimately resulting in a harsh reality check in 2022.",
      "The “Inside Men,” the “Capital Captains,” the “Ecosystem Builders” — these deal-making maestros are expected to guide their LPs through the tumultuous seas of VC, identifying the most promising opportunities and steering clear of stormy waters. Yet, all too often, they find themselves shrouded in fog, led astray by cunning competitors in a dog-eat-dog world, or, even worse, blinded by their own hubris. These fearless financiers, instead of acting as beacons of insight, sometimes end up obscuring the very deals they were meant to illuminate, or worse, being seduced by the siren songs of their peers. In the treacherous world of VC, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye, it’s crucial for these intrepid investors to maintain their wits and resist the lure of the ever-present traps that lie in wait. IPO is an expensive and lengthy process, involving costs such as legal fees, accounting fees, and underwriting fees. Companies have to disclose a significant amount of financial information, which can be costly and time-consuming to prepare. For profitable startups that do not need cash, these costs may not be justifiable in light of the benefits they would receive. Moreover, the company may have found other alternatives such as private equity or debt financing. These alternatives offer more flexibility and lower costs compared to going public.",
      "Another reason why profitable startups may not want to go public is that it can change the dynamic of the company focusing on short-term financial results, which can be at odds with the company’s long-term vision and goals. Going public can also create a situation where the company has to answer to a large number of shareholders, which can make it difficult for the company to make decisions quickly and efficiently.",
      "Given the current market conditions where the IPO market is not as attractive as it used to be, the process of going public can become more difficult and the IPO process might not be successful. That can lead to the company not being able to raise the funds it was expecting and not achieving the desired valuation. Policymakers need to develop standardized rules and regulations and incentivize these companies by offering tax breaks or other incentives which would help reduce risks associated. This will bridge the disconnect between older investors and younger entrepreneurs and ensure that all involved parties have trust in each other."

      "THE “2022 tech reset” really showed everyone the non existence of smart money, I mean even the most experienced investors were not able to predict it. You don’t need an expert telling you in the face of uncertainty: reevaluate strategy, be resilient and adaptable, you know these things already. We have seen the mighty fall, so we would surely also know about adaptability. Only death puts life into perspective. The death of a boom placed emphasis on a q management team’s ability to grow and execute funding. Even the Vision Fund, once a “disruptor” in the industry, faced financial difficulties, and they too had to change things up.",
      "The Southeast Asia ecosystem post the 2022 cycle will likely stick with the ongoing digital transformation, developing solutions for the digital economy, including e-commerce, digital payments, and fintech. Increased focus on sustainable solutions, concerns about the environment and social impact will become more prominent. Big corporations and multinationals are now recognizing the value of working with startups, both as a source of innovation and as a way to tap into new markets and customer segments.",
      "Also, there will be more focus on improving the investment climate, making it easier for startups to raise capital and scale their businesses. Government initiatives and support will also play a key role in this, as they strive to foster a more conducive environment for startup growth and success.",
      "Additionally, the region will see more international focus as more global VCs and corporates will be looking to tap into the fast-growing Southeast Asian market, which will provide more opportunities for local startups to expand globally. All that does not really sound like E=mc2 right? It actually sounds sensible and simple, so if you are not Einstein but you are informed, you have a shot.",
      "LPs are a diverse group of investors that can come in many forms. As mentioned in the earlier chapters, in Southeast Asia, we see the absence of endowment and pension funds, but there are executives, corporates, entrepreneurs, and FOs. Each type of LP has its own particularity in investment choice. Executives may be more interested in companies in their current industry or field of expertise. Entrepreneurs tend to incline towards high growth startups. FOs go after companies with the same values and long-term investment goals. Corporates vie for companies that can provide strategic benefits to their existing business operations. VC's main job is to deploy capital into promising high returns startups. LPs are more selective because they want more. As an LP, it may seem like there are two layers of fees to consider when investing in a VC fund, but there could also be a double layer of gains, if you know what you’re looking for.",
      "Say a VC firm like Accel Partners invests in a Southeast Asian seed fund like Seedplus, it will get to learn the unfamiliar ecosystem to later be able to decide whether it fancies jumping all in, and quit the LP gig. For a large company like Yahoo Japan, a $10 million investment may not make a significant difference in their overall portfolio, but the strategic acquisition will open up channels. LPs looking to enter Southeast Asia will have a problem if it invests based on GDP alone. It is not a metric you want to use in these chartered lands with six different currencies, six different regulations, compared to only one in Europe or the US or China. LPs must be able to manage that and add currency conversion and compliance requirements into the tab. It would constitute such a meticulous calculation for a low purchase-power market. Some say the market’s not worth tinkering with, not for so little money.",
      "Big LPs are not attracted to tiny funds running in Southeast Asia. Micro funds, those with assets under management of less than $100 million, typically don’t have access to the big LPs. Experienced investors understand the investment landscape and often want to spread their investments across different vintage years. For example, investing in funds that were raised during the 2020-2021 period may be considered too expensive, as valuations were high during this period. On the other hand, funds raised in 2023 may offer more favorable valuations, but the duration of these funds is still several years away, and no LP wants to wait the next 8 - 10 years. They prefer shorter fund life this time around. This makes it difficult for LPs to plan their investments and decide which funds to invest in. The current economic situation in Southeast Asia does not make big players drool over it. Funds that are announcing plans to enter the region in the coming years are likely to focus on their core markets instead, which will dry up much of the capital needed to grow the next cycle. Thus emerges a brave new era, in which FOs, corporate titans, and deep-pocketed elites boldly venture forth to establish their own investment arms, casting aside the gospel of excitement of traditional VCs with a dismissive wave. The reign of the VC middlemen may be facing its twilight, as these trailblazing financiers charge ahead, confident in their ability to seize opportunities and reap the rewards for themselves. Armed with their own unique insights and expertise, they challenge the status quo, forging a new path in the world of investing that could change the landscape forever.",
      "One example of this is Tiger Global, who invested in many startups in Southeast Asia last year, but rumors indicate that their GP also invested their own money — smaller checks by GP individuals, not the Fund - into smaller VC funds for deal flow. This suggests that they are waiting for more favorable conditions before committing larger sums of money to the region. The VCs who boast of having raised $100 million in reality may only have $10-20 million in the bank. They have to do a capital call to get the money they need to invest. How can LPs make money at this stage?",
      "Management fees? LPs are not interested in giving GP management fees, they should get from carry. The only way to increase the income is to increase the fund size. This creates an efficiency gap in the startup investment ecosystem, especially when it comes to the relationships between GP and LP. Should GPs focus more on building relationships with LPs or should they focus on deploying the money? As a GP, it is important to find a balance between the two and to keep in mind that the ultimate goal is to help the startups grow and provide returns to the LPs. After the whole pandemic showdown with the economy, downstream capital has dried up in Southeast Asia. We will have to plough through this till the next 5 to 10 years. Major funds such as KKR, Warburg Pincus, and other large funds from Europe and Japan that invested heavily in the region are ending their cycle. Top up is unlikely considering they are still figuring out the market. They have not nailed it yet. This means that it will be increasingly difficult for startups to secure Series C, D, and above funding.",
      "Let’s not cry over spilled milk. Local investors should step up and fill the gap left by the major funds. We are talking about VC firms, angel investors, and other local financial institutions, who can play their part if they are willing to take on the risk of investing in startups.",
      "We have gotten so used to the valuation game for the past 10 years or so that all we care about is getting money. There are other things companies can do to toughen up instead of waiting for that money to drop from the sky. Develop revenue streams, cut costs and build strong relationships with customers and partners — the actual leg work. The idea of clocking an exit during a recession is far fetched. Look around, companies that have done an IPO have struggled to maintain their stock price after going public. Choosing an exit path through corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is a possibility, but everyone is really cutting costs and conserving what they have.",
      "There is, of course, sale of secondary shares, at a discount of 20% to 30%. This can be an attractive option for funds looking to liquidate one or two companies in their portfolio. However, it is not a viable option for companies looking to maintain their 18% to 20% IRR.",
      "The reason I haven’t lost faith despite the current predicament is because technology is constantly transforming every industry. The simplest innovation can pick up the game. What’s more, our market is continuing to flourish, boasting the biggest working age population, an expanding tech use and a growing middle class. Those are excellent tell tale signs if you are a VC, no?",
      "In a nutshell, 2023 and 2024 is going to be a difficult year, but I believe people who are willing to put in the hard work will make it through. Some are going to bend during this time, as few funds will be out and about. From Startups to VCs to LPs, it is still too early to tell for the Southeast Asian ecosystem. Let’s hope we all can sustain, as the digital economy should become stronger once it passes the trial of the century. THE DEAL FLOW ISSUE",
      "THE drought of smart money and high quality founders in Southeast Asia is concerning. Not to say there aren’t enough great young minds with noble intentions, but even the road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? The hard truth is that praiseworthy intentions and ambitions alone will not guarantee success in tech without chops and experience. The best bet is investment in sectors adjacent to the existing verticals of e-commerce and fintech for the next decade or so.",
      "An entrepreneur may propose a solution to reduce long wait times at popular restaurants in Jakarta, such as an app that offers incentives for making table reservations. While this may seem like a promising idea, it fails to address the underlying reasons why table reservations will not be widely adopted in Jakarta. Factors such as the city’s notorious traffic, which makes sticking to a fixed schedule difficult for many people, and the popularity of food delivery apps, which allow consumers to avoid traffic altogether, work against the adoption of this solution. Additionally, the market for high end dining is relatively small. These are just a few examples of the variables that make this idea less likely to succeed. The key point is that the entrepreneur has not yet identified the root cause of the problem they are trying to solve. I was particularly interested in startups that operate in large but underdeveloped sectors in Indonesia, such as insurance. Currently, only about 2% of people in Indonesia have insurance coverage, and it is likely that as the middle class grows, demand for insurance policies will increase. For this reason, I invested in a startup that aims to make insurance more accessible, affordable, and easy to use for all, particularly through online platforms. This was a worthwhile investment for me, especially since the founding team met my other criteria for a good investment opportunity. Global perspective a.k.a the bigger picture a.k.a larger scheme of things is what I zoom into when making investment calls. Founders with working experience who have studied and spent a great amount of time in more developed tech ecosystems and able to draw comparisons to local habitat, will get my attention. Detailed rationale and personal anecdotes from the founder if something fails in China will work here. Having a vision, really means, having a defined sense. Indonesia is expected to continue its resilient economic performance next year despite the challenges that the global economy is facing. The tech sector will be affected by the end of the first cycle and is forecasted to continue its correction path. Rising interest rate will improve banking sector liquidity with a net interest margin caveat. The country is blessed with natural resources, and strong commodity exports will save the day, while our raw materials will refine our income. So long as people eat, make machinery parts and consume fossil fuel, we will be in demand; at least until climate change smacks us in the face or some big industrial revolution takes place. Capital inflow tends to favor emerging markets like Southeast Asia, where the population is still growing, unlike well developed counterparts where the birth rate is plunging . Money will eventually come because we have the people who will spend it.",
      "The rising interest rate definitely bumped up the cost of borrowing for businesses and households, slowing down the economic growth. But the government smelled the stink and introduced policies to support micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and affordable housing developments, the sectors sensitive to interest rate changes, so fingers crossed. With more than 50% of the population entering their prime spending years, demographic dividend is also a saving grace for growth. But there is no telling yet if the young market is internet literate and speaks tech. If they do and they do it fluently, it will make a big difference to our startup scene.",
      "Then, when the bandwagon of executives, corporates, second generation of high-net-worths, and even politicians get involved, they will get the party going, which is good coverage for investment, but, still, it’s not just about hype. Excitement is a start; sustainable business models and financial practicality are the fundamentals of running a successful business.",
      "In a way, the startup funding ecosystem in Southeast Asia in 2023 is repeating the 2015 episode. Eight years ago, the investment slowdown was propelled by the global economic downturn. This time, it’s pandemic driven. Both fiascos turn investors to become more cautious and sensible in looking for startups that have a clear path to profitability. 2015 was in its nascent stages with only two unicorn companies, Garena (before it was renamed as SEA) based in Singapore, and VNG in Vietnam, but the promise was there. Today, only a few are willing to take the risk and invest in the region that is notoriously known for its localities.",
      "Perhaps, this is why some of the LPs decided to take matters into their own hands and began to do their own groundwork on the potential new sectors, legal aspects, and even to the extent of figuring out who’s who on the ground. This would one day help them to make more informed decisions on how to invest and partner up with the right local players. Wax in, wax out. We needed the global halt more than we think we did. What happened with the downturn really got us to see the ecosystem with different sets of eyes. Post 2022 VCs understood it’s not only about how much money you’re going to make but also acknowledging the risks that come with that money by applying due diligence, legal considerations, and evaluating the economic stability of each country. For LPs who are not familiar with the region, it means thoroughly researching and vetting potential partners, such as local VCs and angel investors. This includes obtaining full disclosure on specific deals and ensuring that partners have a good track record and are trustworthy. I have worked with foreign LPs who would rather take the slow bureaucratic path of CVC than deal with a pool of VCs. CVCs, or any alternative equity investments backed by large conglomerates, prioritize compliance and due diligence. Co-GP structure (where multiple partners share fund management responsibilities) provides security and allows LPs to learn from other’s blunders for better informed calls. MDI Ventures exercised the Co-GP structure in 2017 with foreign investors, one of the few CVCs in Southeast Asia that set the bar in that regard. BRI Ventures followed suit in 2021 with its secondary fund, recognizing the benefits of regional collaboration and the advantages of having multiple partners that can bring their expertise and perspectives to the table.",
      "In Southeast Asia, it’s the big FOs and large corporations that birthed CVC funds unlike the US or China markets where big tech giants paved the way for CVCs. Google Ventures, Intel Capital, Baidu Ventures, and M12 (formerly Microsoft Ventures) are to name a few from such parent companies and have already deployed capital around the world. Our CVCs are still trying to gain a foothold for digital transformation, diversified telecoms conglomerates, and others. In our case, being backed by the largest state-owned telecom company in Indonesia, sends a clear message that we have our thumb on the pulse of adjacent verticals to the internet business, a lucrative message.",
      "Some CVC profiles will greatly differ from others. Whatever kind of investor you are, you should be able to see all cards on deck. CVC firms should offer startups more than just money, they should propose tailor made strategies based on their respective expertise. That is a pretty picture if you are the kind of investor who knows what they want. For example, the largest mobile carrier in the nation could potentially become a robust user acquisition apparatus for mobile ad tech companies. Likewise, a corporate bridge to the nation’s state-owned banks can have sweeping implications for the potential success of a new fintech startup. When evaluating a CVC fund in Southeast Asia, it is important to look for a fund that has a clear thesis and decision-making process based on a hypothesis. The best CVC players are those who recognize that to succeed in the future, they must aim to disrupt the core business model of their corporate benefactor before someone else does. There is a standing joke in Hollywood that goes: if you can’t be the best, you can still be the first.",
      "The thesis of most CVC goes something like this: startup growth in Indonesia hasn’t been distributed evenly across all market segments and channels so far, and we have the strategy to do so. This prompts us to invest in startups that can grow fast via our existing business units and open up new revenue streams for us.",
      "If a CVC firm is not able to convey a coherent thesis that revolves around anything other than financial returns, it is a red flag. It shows that the leadership hasn’t put in enough thought into what they’re doing with the fund in the first place. It’s important to understand the exit scenarios — in Southeast Asia virtually all startup exits will be via M&A for the foreseeable future. Any worthwhile CVC player should come equipped with built-in pathways for portfolio companies to exit via corporate acquisition. If a CVC firm is unable to speak to this, consider it a no go. CVC provides a safe and viable pathway for western investors to capitalize on tech in emerging Asia. CVC LPs gain a peace of mind from the fact that their capital is in the game and being deployed responsibly by a team of experienced professionals who must comply with all regulations. When it comes to legal hoops, they also get the upside of mitigating a mountain of legal red-tape that might otherwise slow things down with traditional VC funds.",
      "Yes, 2022 was tough, and it looks as though there is a reason why we were not able to do what others were doing: getting that $1 billion exit without prioritizing compliance and due process provides a layer of security in this hostile market full of booby traps. After all, it is the Wild-Wild-South to-the-East. Alright?",
      "Even though everything in the market is at a temporary halt at this point, I am still confident in investing. As an investor, it is important to not miss out on periods of innovation and the economic cycle of startups in particular. However, I am mindful of realistic entrepreneurs who understand that building a successful business takes hard work and commitment over a period of several years. I look for entrepreneurs who have exceptional skills, a passion for the disruption they are masterminding, and a cost-conscious mindset to ensure they will be able to sustain their business over the long term. It is important to note that building billion-dollar businesses typically takes 7-10 years, which means operating through at least one full economic cycle, if not two."

I have had the privilege of meeting talented entrepreneurs who understand the need to build their businesses through both prosperous and difficult economic times. When I find individuals with this mindset, synergy is invariably sparked. However, I am also aware of the significant headwinds facing our ecosystem, and this does raise concerns about the potential growth rates in the next five years. I have written about this topic in the past, and my opinion has not changed since then. It is important to remember that for every set of global issues, there are entrepreneurs working to find solutions and lead us into the next 20 years. This is what I find so exciting about entrepreneurship and VC; the opportunity to support and invest in the talents who hold the key to our future.",
      "The recent announcements of losses from Softbank and Tiger Global have brought attention to the importance of liquidity in the startup ecosystem. It has become clear that what is needed in the current ecosystem is not another valuation story, but liquidity. Valuations, no matter how high, do not matter if there is not enough cash flow to support the business.",
      "Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem is challenging because many startups are at a fragile stage, and a lack of funding can lead to failure. The momentum of tech stock valuations heading downward early this year adds salt to the wound. This is why it is important to restore the balance for liquidity in the ecosystem. There is a need to open up more capital from larger funds for Indonesia’s next generation of startups, especially in light of the current challenges. More liquidity equips startups to survive the winter and continue to grow and develop.",
      "Some investors are still in the denial stage and turning a blind eye to the crunch’s ripple effect on the ecosystem as a whole. I think it’s not a clever move, not taking necessary steps to mitigate the impact of the lack of funds will be too costly.",
      "In the past, disruptors to the system were never portrayed as nice guys, but history does not record the obedient. Pushing boundaries really means sticking it up to the man, challenging the status quo. Tech pioneers, no matter how geeky and rebellious-looking. Vikings in the dark ages raided and pillaged swiftly before the sun came out. They came strong and they came fast without permission and invitation. Surprise!",
      "Don’t get me wrong; I’m not suggesting you break any laws. Sustainable in Amazon’s dictionary meant taking 7 years to reach profitability, even after 4 years of being listed on NASDAQ. I am highlighting that restless spirit within us that believes there has got to be a better, simpler, faster way of doing what we are doing. I know things take time. You know, we know. Viking’s quick reflexes stemmed from meticulous planning and knowing their power. Tech pioneers’ rebellion came out of displeasure with the rate things were going. Modern-day startups must be able to move quickly and adapt to changing market conditions if they hope to reach higher ground and achieve success. It’s also important to keep in mind that sustainable success requires more than just speed; it requires careful planning, hard work, and the ability to navigate challenges and setbacks along the way. Indonesia’s Series B and above companies are currently facing a critical test, and those that successfully manage to navigate the challenges of 2023 will emerge as the bedrock for the next cycle of growth and innovation. On the other hand, companies that fail to endure these trials will carry the ‘failure badge’ into their subsequent ventures, hopefully learning from their experiences and building better enterprises in the future.",
      "As the dynamic saga of the startup ecosystem unfolds, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of fraudulent players who have consistently exploited various crises to further their goals. These opportunistic individuals have taken advantage of numerous events, including the Covid pandemic, the startup winter, the Silicon Valley Bank collapse (which had a minimal impact on Southeast Asia), and other ‘black swan’ occurrences. Surprisingly, despite their deceitful activities, some of these individuals show no signs of vanishing from the startup scene anytime soon.",
      "Instead, these unscrupulous actors may rebrand themselves as ‘veteran founders’ or ‘victims of the long, cold startup winter,’ among other similar narratives. By adopting such personas, they can maintain a low profile and bide their time until the next bull market arrives, ready to seize new opportunities to advance their questionable objectives. Consequently, it becomes even more critical for investors, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders in the startup ecosystem to remain vigilant and discerning when it comes to identifying and dealing with these deceptive players. For newcomers to the startup ecosystem, it can be challenging to differentiate between genuine founders and fraudulent actors, as everything may seem to boil down to a blame game. In such a scenario, accusations and counter accusations fly, with both sides relying on their respective ‘backup’ strategies when confronted with litigation and liquidation threats. In this complex and high-stakes environment, it becomes all the more important to exercise caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and rely on trusted sources of information and guidance.",
      "The old Wild West saying, “This town ain’t big enough for the both of us,” aptly captures the sentiment of an environment where two parties with conflicting interests cannot coexist. In the startup ecosystem, this phrase takes on a more figurative meaning, suggesting that the landscape is becoming increasingly crowded with both genuine innovators and unscrupulous opportunists. As the ecosystem grows and evolves, it is up to the community to ensure that the legitimate players thrive while the fraudulent ones are exposed and marginalized.",
      "To maintain the integrity and long-term sustainability of the startup ecosystem, it is vital to establish clear lines of communication, support systems, and mentorship opportunities for budding entrepreneurs. By fostering an environment of openness, collaboration, and mutual support, the startup community can make it more challenging for fraudulent players to gain a foothold and thrive. Additionally, by sharing experiences and lessons learned, both new and seasoned entrepreneurs can benefit from the collective wisdom of their peers and avoid falling prey to the machinations of unscrupulous individuals.",
      "Establishing and adhering to ethical standards and best practices within the startup ecosystem is also essential to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders involved. By promoting a culture of transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct, the startup community can work together to weed out fraudulent actors and protect the ecosystem from their harmful influence.",
      "For investors, if there is anything we could learn from the past 10 years is to avoid FOMO, but it begs a highly important question: is there still honor among VCs? In Silicon Valley, at least from my brief observations and from the literature I’ve read about the cradle of innovation and the place to foster talents, there are unspoken codes in place. While not universally applicable, some unspoken codes exist in Silicon Valley, which can be considered as the unwritten rules or norms that guide behavior and decision making within the tech community, such as “Fail fast, learn faster,” “Meritocracy,” “Pay it forward,” “High risk, high reward,” among others. These principles are frequently coined and evolve over time, much like simplified versions of Greek philosophical idioms.",
      "The unspoken codes of Silicon Valley have played a pivotal role in fostering the region’s unique culture, which has allowed it to become a global epicenter for technology and innovation. The core principles of collaboration, risk-taking, long-term relationship building, and prioritizing growth have enabled the region to consistently produce disruptive startups and cutting-edge technologies.",
      "In recent years, Southeast Asia’s VC landscape has evolved rapidly, with many VCs in the region embracing these unspoken codes as they adapt to the local context. This adoption and adaptation of Silicon Valley’s unspoken rules have helped foster a vibrant and dynamic startup ecosystem in Southeast Asia. However, it’s important to note that the region’s diverse tech communities have also resulted in localized variations of these norms.",
      "At the onset of Southeast Asia’s startup boom, exits were more of a ‘big idea’ than a reality for many early stage companies. VCs in the region were primarily focused on promoting the growth and development of the ecosystem, often investing in multiple startups and evangelizing the potential of technology and innovation. The ‘fake it till you make it,’ as the Silicon Valley players often call it. It takes place in 2023, at a time when a New York Times article has highlighted recent charges, convictions, and sentences against founders, suggesting a shift in Silicon Valley’s culture. As funding has dried up for cash-burning startups and investors scrutinize claims more closely, several high-profile fraud cases have emerged, signaling an end to the ‘fake it till you make it’ ethos. Some examples include the arrests of Charlie Javice, Rishi Shah, Elizabeth Holmes, Carlos Watson, Christopher Kirchner, and upcoming trials for Manish Lachwani and Sam Bankman-Fried. A funding downturn may be to blame, as unethical behavior can be overlooked during prosperous times. However, when easy money dries up, the truth is often revealed. As more startup frauds are exposed, venture capital investors are increasingly portrayed as victims in lawsuits and bankruptcy filings. Consequently, investors are tightening up their assessment protocols, and startups are facing the consequences of playing fast and loose with the truth. The recent events emphasize the need for stricter oversight and more accurate evaluation of founders, leading to a shift in Silicon Valley’s culture. As a result, the early days of the region’s venture capital scene were marked by a sense of exclusivity and camaraderie, with VCs generally avoiding discussions about struggling or fraudulent startups.",
      "As the startup ecosystem in Southeast Asia matured, the unspoken Silicon Valley’s codes started to take root, influencing how VCs in the region approached their investments and relationships with founders. One key aspect of this transformation was the growing emphasis on founder friendly approaches, which prioritized collaboration and support for entrepreneurs while minimizing control and restrictive terms.",
      "Despite the adoption of many of Silicon Valley’s unspoken codes, Southeast Asia’s VC ecosystem remains diverse, with variations in how these norms are interpreted and applied across the region. This can be attributed to factors such as cultural differences, local regulations, and varying stages of ecosystem development. This approach proved to be constructive for those who genuinely valued integrity, but it has also been exploited by individuals who view startup activity as a means or a scheme to get rich quickly. As this is the end of the “faking it” in Silicon Valley, I believe this could spur significant change in Southeast Asia’s startup and VC culture most definitely!"

    "THE BEGINNING OF AN END?": [
      "AH, yes. The suspenseful subheading, a personal favorite. A wise man once told me, “A decade ago, being a VC wasn’t considered a real job in this corner of the globe, and it might lose that status in the decade to come.” But isn’t that the game we play here, where solid deals are hard to come by and the exit market remains shrouded in uncertainty?” Indeed, I’ve previously alluded to a few instances of the high-stakes drama and intrigue that embodies the startup and VC ecosystem — the sudden evaporation of once-plentiful dry powder (ironic, isn’t it?), and the increasingly daunting challenges facing LPs as they attempt to navigate the untamed expanse of Southeast Asia’s startup landscape. Perhaps you may have caught whispers about the questionable behavior of certain founders like those of startups “A,” “B,” “C,” all the way to “T,” or most recently, a certain Stenmo in Singapore, who allegedly filled their bags with investor cash and vanished into thin air. It is an age-old narrative, really, with origins dating back to the industry’s birth in 2009. Back then, these sly founders would target angel investors and high-net-worth individuals — same modus operandi: secure the funds and disappear. VCs were largely absent from this scheme, primarily due to their sparse presence in the region.",
      "Take startup “B” for instance: with revenue barely scraping $5,000, losses towering at a whopping $19 million, and employee benefits tallying up to $5 million — it’s certainly a time to be alive, wouldn’t you agree?",
      "As a VC, witnessing the collapse of a few startups within your portfolio is par for the course. These failures could stem from poor timing, internal conflict, getting outplayed by competitors, among other reasons. But when a handful of startups within your portfolio are embroiled in fraudulent activities, well, that’s a horse of a different color. It hints at a deeper, more insidious issue. It’s not merely about due diligence, but rather an indication that someone, somewhere, knew what was about to unfold and figured out how to profit from it. Or, they made a bet expecting a certain outcome, but managed to reap benefits even when their prediction didn’t pan out. And many believe that eventually this will be a broken system for both investors and startup founders. LPs that I’ve met say that they would have a shorter appetite in a VC fund, only 4-5 years compared to the 8-10 (+1) years. This issue is a ticking time bomb at the heart of the industry, whether we choose to acknowledge it or not. The tangle of conflicts of interest among VC partners is more intricate than a Gordian knot. The dilemma isn’t merely about what to invest in or what to steer clear of, but more about maneuvering their firms into favorable positions amidst cutthroat competition. In the Southeast Asian landscape, it’s not unheard of for VC firms to rub shoulders with officials or institutions, seeking endorsements with the ultimate goal of gaining more capital through these affiliations. The sun is setting on the era of venture capitalists acting as middlemen, and the twilight promises to be slow and painful. LPs will slam the brakes on their capital deployment, a move that will strangle the growth of their portfolio and potentially even stifle the broader ecosystem. This is a particularly grim prospect for early stage startups, who are just starting to find their feet.",
      "We’re already witnessing the early signs of change, as more FOs are tiptoeing into startup investment, sidestepping the middlemen to control a small portion of their AUM directly. Corporate entities are also changing their tune. They’re no longer engaging with funds of funds, but instead are assembling their own teams — often composed of seasoned professionals who know the lay of the land. The endgame? To establish their own venture arm divisions, or if that fails, to build bridges and connections via other CVCs. Corporate entities are also becoming more selective when it comes to follow-on rounds. Their participation won’t be as automatic as it once was. Instead, they’re turning their sights towards venture-building activities, where they believe they can contribute more value to a project without a VC playing middleman.",
      "Angel investors, meanwhile, are set to enjoy their moment in the sun. As many LPs lean on their expertise — without the burden of fees and carry interest — when pursuing a deal. This new arrangement creates a win-win situation for angel investors, LPs, corporates, and FOs alike, as they engage in pursuits that promise mutual benefits for all parties involved. So while the sun may be setting on one era, it’s simultaneously rising on another, equally exciting chapter, especially amid the rise of blockchain, generative AI, and other emerging sectors. The CVCs aren’t leaving the stage just yet, even though their encore performance might face some harsh reviews from their parent holdings. Indeed, CVCs are the agents of transformation in this grand spectacle, but their trailblazing initiatives might just boomerang back at them. Resistance to change is a perennial challenge, and any negative press serves as potent ammunition for those opposing the metamorphosis. Now, those VCs with strong ties to FOs or colossal conglomerates aren’t sitting idle, waiting for the curtain to drop. They’re already on the move, scouting out emerging markets like Vietnam and Africa, where the audience is eager for their performance. Especially those second or third generation FOs, with a more aggressive approach than their previous first generation. Others are considering a costume change, morphing their operations into a Private Equity/ Venture Capital hybrid act, which promises a compelling narrative of value creation for their group, in a way similar to CVC operations in working to build collaboration and synergy value in dollar, establishing business with the group’s existing unit to thrive.",
      "Let’s take a moment to acknowledge how the VC industry, for the past decade, has treated business fundamentals with the same interest as a cat treats a cucumber — with blatant disregard and suspicion. Remember the times when company valuations were tethered to something as whimsical as monthly active users, and then we decided to take a carousel ride with GMV multiples, which made way for revenue multiples, only to later snuggle up to EBITDA multiples. If you’ve been tracking the breadcrumbs laid throughout this narrative, you’ll know that this merry-go-round of valuation metrics is exactly how we found ourselves down this rabbit hole. The corrections to these valuation yardsticks were about as reliable as a chameleon in a bag of Skittles. Rather than making sensible adjustments during successive rounds of fundraising, we all turned into wide-eyed spectators, captivated by the tantalizing allure of upside and, dare I say it, the intoxicating allure of exponential growth. It was a spectacle to behold, a game of high stakes that only fueled our collective appetite for risk and reward.",
      "In the theatre of finance, the only constant is change. It’s a performance with an ever-changing cast, a dynamic script, and an audience that craves innovation. So, curtain up on the new era. Let’s see what surprises the next act holds."

As mentioned in the earlier chapter, companies that managed to raise substantial funding during the ‘fake boom’ of 2021 will eventually have to face the consequences of their actions. Certain unicorns may be ‘demoted’ to centaurs (companies valued over $100 million but under $1 billion), and some centaurs may be downgraded to ponies or completely dissolved.",
      "In 2021, equity funding from venture capital in Southeast Asia rose to a total of $13.8 billion, a noteworthy increase from $8.2 billion in 2020 and $8.5 billion in 2019. This underscores the persistent expansion and maturation of the venture capital industry in Southeast Asia, with more investors recognizing the potential in the region’s startup landscape.",
      "Indonesia poses a distinctive challenge for overseas investors seeking to exploit the potential of the country’s swiftly burgeoning tech market. Apart from regulatory obstacles, investors frequently grapple with understanding the complexities of Indonesian cultural norms, traditions, and consumer patterns. A profound comprehension of these facets is essential for businesses aiming to successfully adapt and flourish in this diverse market.",

      "The examples given include successful startups from Southeast Asia, such as Tokopedia, Gojek, and Grab, which have disrupted traditional industries through the use of technology. The statement also implies that there will not be another app connecting different groups of people, such as teachers and students or doctors and patients, that is backed by VC funding.",
      "The reasoning behind this is that these types of startups have already been established, and their success has created a crowded market. Additionally, the cost of starting and scaling a new venture in these categories has increased, making it harder for newcomers to compete with established players. Starting a business like this would be the equivalent of someone trying to start a social media company like Facebook in the late 2010s or an e-commerce company like Amazon in the early 2000s. These markets have already been dominated by established players, making it difficult for new entrants to gain traction. The next wave of startups may need to focus on more innovative and disruptive business models that address the emerging markets. These startups may need to explore areas such as generative AI or blockchain to create new solutions that can revolutionize different industries. While it’s tough to forecast the precise relevance of the information presented here over the next ten years, I’d like to underline its significance for budding entrepreneurs and investors, especially those who are delving into the world of startups and investment for the first time.

The exponential growth and evolution of digital ecosystems in Indonesia and Southeast Asia have been nothing short of astonishing. New startups have sprouted, innovative solutions have been crafted, and unique opportunities have emerged, culminating in a lively and flourishing environment. As an emerging founder or investor, you have a crucial role in sculpting the next wave of innovation in the region. By spotting market gaps, understanding your target audience’s needs, and employing inventive strategies, you could potentially build the next significant entity that could transform the industry. The cooperative spirit of the digital ecosystem provides abundant opportunities for networking and learning from the triumphs and setbacks of predecessors. This milieu allows you to sharpen your skills, polish your ideas, and develop as an entrepreneur or investor.",
      "Therefore, while predicting the exact future might be impossible, the potential for transformation and growth in Indonesia and Southeast Asia’s digital ecosystems is unquestionable. As a prospective founder or investor, you can facilitate a new age of innovation and wealth by adopting the essence of entrepreneurship, critically evaluating your ideas, and remaining dedicated to your vision. The upcoming decade promises to be as thrilling and transformative as the last one, with your contributions playing a vital role in molding the future of Indonesia and Southeast Asia’s digital ecosystem. It’s crucial to understand that the region’s technology landscape is continuously evolving, and the innovation focus will likely shift as new opportunities and challenges emerge. While e-commerce platforms and P2P lending fintech services have held sway in the digital arena in the past, it’s highly likely that these sectors have reached or are approaching a consolidation phase. Consequently, we may see a limited number of dominant players, with the market featuring duopolies or monopolies.",
      "The swift speed of technological advancement over the past decade has profoundly changed our lives. When contrasting our experiences in 2010 with today, it’s clear that a plethora of innovations have redefined how we connect, work, and live.",
      "In retrospect, those who doubted the potential of e-commerce, e-wallets, and banking apps in 2012 might find themselves astonished by how these technologies have become integral to our daily routines. Reflecting on the missed signals, skeptics from that time may now recognize the importance of staying attuned to emerging trends and technological innovations. By closely monitoring developments in the tech industry, individuals can better anticipate and capitalize on opportunities for growth and transformation.",
      "E-commerce, e-wallets, banking apps, and perhaps P2P services have significantly disrupted traditional businesses, forcing them to adapt or risk obsolescence. Retail, finance, and banking sectors have all undergone massive changes as a result of these innovations. Consumers now enjoy the convenience and efficiency offered by these technologies, while businesses have had to develop new strategies to remain competitive and relevant in the digital age. During 2022-2023, we’ve seen major headlines discussing various concerns, such as the stability of the $, the potential collapse of the banking system, conflicts that could lead to another world war, and the threat of advanced AI. However, by filtering out some of the noise, it becomes possible to identify emerging trends that may have a significant impact on the future: Blockchain/Web3, Applied AI, and potentially robotics or quantum computing. As business founders and investors, concentrating on at least two of these three fields might hold more importance than establishing another on demand service platform or e-commerce website in the near term.",
      "Blockchain/Web3: The emergence of blockchain technology and the shift towards Web3 could potentially overhaul various sectors, from finance to supply chain management. Decentralized platforms, intelligent contracts, and secure data storage are a few instances of how this technology can be employed. By delving into these aspects, entrepreneurs and investors can leverage the transformative potential of blockchain and Web3, cultivating innovation and creating fresh opportunities.",
      "Generative AI: The progression of artificial intelligence is relentless, and its applications extend to several industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, and customer service. Solutions driven by AI can assist businesses in enhancing their efficiency, making improved decisions, and delivering more tailored experiences to their customers. By investing in and devising AI-enabled solutions, entrepreneurs can develop disruptive products and services that transform industries and provide substantial value to consumers.",
      "Indeed, we stand at the brink of another digital revolution, and when it materializes, those capable of effectively linking these emergent trends will be best placed to prosper. Perhaps the next momentum would be Generative AI like what everyone’s been saying. I used the assistance of ChatGPT to finish this book especially when I needed to connect some of the difficult paragraphs. Or maybe even going into another crypto cycle once again. We shall see.",
      "In the past few years, I have had the opportunity to converse with numerous Indonesian VCs, and one recurring theme has emerged in our discussions: venture building. This concept has increasingly gained traction in the Indonesian startup ecosystem, and for good reason. The market has turned bearish, with global startup funding plummeting by more than 50% in Q1 2023 across all stages, even within the AI sector. Although it might be too soon to make definitive claims, the Indonesian VC landscape is undeniably evolving in response to these new challenges.",
      "As discussed in earlier chapters, the Indonesian VC scene is characterized by its close ties to family conglomerates, which are often led by the second or third generation of these entrepreneurial dynasties. These families have been instrumental in supporting the rise of numerous Indonesian unicorns not too long ago. Their unique position and accumulated wisdom, having observed the market for the past decade and invested heavily in entrepreneurs, puts them in an advantageous position to adapt and innovate. Getting inspiration from their parents or grandparents, who built successful businesses by bringing together talented individuals with great ideas and the financial resources to support them, these modern-day Indonesian VCs are increasingly embracing the venture building model. This approach involves assembling a team of experienced professionals, ideally with a solid digital background and industry knowledge spanning the past 8-10 years, and providing them with the capital and resources needed to turn innovative ideas into successful ventures.",
      "While the bottom-up approach, wherein VCs actively search for promising entrepreneurs, has indeed provided new opportunities and injected vitality into the startup ecosystem, it is crucial to remember that this method is not without its challenges. In the midst of the gold rush for lucrative investments, there are instances where both entrepreneurs and VCs engage in questionable practices. Amid the fierce competition, some founders may feel compelled to inflate their performance metrics in order to appear more attractive to investors. This could involve falsifying numbers or painting an overly optimistic picture of their startup’s progress. In such cases, VCs might be tempted to turn a blind eye to these discrepancies and even actively cover up the founders’ mistakes by reassuring everyone that things will work out in the end. This behavior could be driven by the VCs’ desire to maintain their reputation, ensure the success of their portfolio, or secure the interest of larger, more influential investors.",
      "True, not all participants in the startup ecosystem are driven by such unethical motives. However, the prevalence of these practices during times of crisis highlights the need for increased due diligence and transparency in the investment process. To safeguard the integrity of the ecosystem and protect the interests of all stakeholders, VCs and entrepreneurs alike must strive to uphold the highest ethical standards and adhere to a robust code of conduct.",
      "It seems that the days of the bottom-up approach, characteristic of ‘traditional’ VC investing, may soon be numbered. While this method has served the industry well in the past, it is likely to be too slow to accommodate the rapidly changing landscape and the new cycle of growth in the tech sector. By leveraging their unique position, Indonesian VCs have the opportunity to combine the best of both worlds — the entrepreneurial spirit of their predecessors and the cutting-edge knowledge of today’s digital experts — to create a powerful new model for venture building.",
      "In the coming years, we may witness a significant shift in the Indonesian VC landscape as this hybrid model gains momentum. The adoption of venture building could very well propel the country’s startup ecosystem to new heights, fostering the development of innovative solutions and driving economic growth. By striking the right balance between traditional investment strategies and modern entrepreneurship, Indonesian VCs are poised to lead the way in shaping the future of the industry.",
      "Another aspect of the evolving Indonesian VC landscape worth considering is the matter of control in funding rounds. It’s true that Indonesian VCs have reaped substantial returns by partnering with big global funds targeting emerging markets in the Southeast Asian region. However, this influx of foreign capital, while beneficial in the short term, may not be the most sustainable or strategically sound approach for Indonesian VCs in the long run. The crux of the issue lies in the fact that many of these foreign investors may not have a deep understanding of the local market or share the same long-term vision as their Indonesian counterparts. While they are certainly capitalizing on the lucrative opportunities presented to them, they may not be as invested in the long-term growth and development of the Indonesian startup ecosystem. This can potentially lead to misaligned goals and strategies between local VCs and foreign investors.",
      "Sovereign funds, such as the Merah Putih Fund (MPF) and the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA), are poised to play a pivotal role in ensuring the sustainability of financing for startups, particularly in growth and later-stage rounds. By stepping in to fill the gap currently addressed by global funds like Softbank and Tiger Global, these sovereign funds can contribute to a more balanced and locally driven investment landscape. But many experts would say that both funds can’t be just another follow-on rounds to the already bubbling valuations of the startups. If anything these sovereign funds should ‘correct’ the ecosystem that had been pumped-and dumped by investors.",
      "One of the most significant advantages of involving sovereign funds in the financing of startups is their potential to act as a stabilizing force in the market. They can serve as a ‘referee’ to manage the influx of capital into the Indonesian startup ecosystem, ensuring that investments are channeled appropriately and efficiently. By providing a more secure mechanism for investment, sovereign funds can foster greater investor confidence and encourage a more diverse pool of investors to enter the market.",
      "To further strengthen the role of these sovereign funds and encourage foreign LPs to participate, the Indonesian government could consider offering additional incentives. For instance, tax breaks or other financial benefits could be provided to foreign LPs who choose to invest indirectly in Indonesian startups through MPF, INA, or similar local sovereign funds. Such incentives would not only attract more foreign capital but also ensure that these investments are guided and managed by entities with a deep understanding of the local market.",
      "The participation of sovereign funds in startup financing could significantly harmonize investments with national development objectives, driving sectors that profoundly impact Indonesia’s economy and society. This synchronization could, in turn, cultivate a robust and sustainable startup ecosystem, spotlighting enduring growth and value generation. However, until genuine progress is captured and converted into profits, progress in this realm will be limited. Prudent VCs won’t risk repeating the errors of backing startups selling at a loss — hemorrhaging more cash than they make — just for the sake of securing the next funding round. After all, unicorns that surge in market value one day only to crash the next serve as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of this game.",
      "So, it may be some time before we find ourselves once again in the era of the unicorn.",
      "Until then, I’ll see you at the next crossroads of this dynamic venture capital landscape. Stay curious, stay vigilant, and remember — in this industry, the game never stops."
